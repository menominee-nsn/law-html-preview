The purpose of submitting this report is to obtain a preliminary opinion from the Tribe on the potential of the site for development and the advisability of spending additional time and funds to prepare a feasibility report. The Tribe shall review and respond to the initial site report within 90 days of receipt. A favorable determination under this section does not guarantee a favorable determination of site feasibility.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)">(2)</span> An initial site report may be as detailed as the applicant chooses to make it. The greater the detail, the more certain the Tribe can be in its response. For guidance purposes, the following indicates the type and extent of information that might be submitted in a initial site report:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(a)">(a)</span> General site information. The report should identify project title; name, address and telephone number of primary contact person for tribal correspondence; consultant(s); present property owner; proposed disposal site owner and operator; legal description of site by metes and bounds; total acreage of property and proposed licensed acreage; proposed site life and disposal capacity; municipalities, industries and collection and transportation agencies to be served; estimated waste types and estimated weekly quantities to be disposed; anticipated covering frequency; and mode of operation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(b)">(b)</span> Regional geotechnical information. A discussion of the regional setting should be included to provide a basis for comparison and interpretation of any site-specific information obtained through field investigations. The discussion should be limited to information available from publications, although some field verification and updating may be desirable. The term "regional" as utilized herein is intended to include that area which may affect or be affected by the proposed site. In most instances this will be the proposed site and the area within a one-mile radius of the site. The discussions should be supplemented by maps or cross sections, where appropriate. The following items should be addressed:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(b)[1]">[1]</span> Topography, including predominant topographic features.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(b)[2]">[2]</span> Hydrology, including surface water drainage patterns and significant hydrologic features, such as surface waters, springs, drainage divides and wetlands.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(b)[3]">[3]</span> Geology, including the nature and distribution of bedrock and unconsolidated deposits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(b)[4]">[4]</span> Hydrogeology, including depth to groundwater, groundwater flow directions, recharge and discharge areas, groundwater divides, aquifers and the identification of the aquifer used by public and private wells within 1,200 feet of the proposed site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(b)[5]">[5]</span> Groundwater and surface water quality.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(c)">(c)</span> Land use information. A discussion of the present land use of the site and surrounding area should be included. The radius of coverage should extend to all areas that may affect or be affected by the proposed site. In most instances, this will be the proposed site and the area within one mile of the site. The discussion should be supplemented by maps, where appropriate. The following items should be addressed:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(c)[1]">[1]</span> Identification of adjacent landowners.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(c)[2]">[2]</span> Zoning.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(c)[4]">[4]</span> Present or proposed access roads and weight restrictions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(d)">(d)</span> Site-specific geotechnical information. Where the applicant chooses to gather site specific data, the following should be considered:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(d)[1]">[1]</span> Field investigations should be performed to define the site-specific topography, soil types, and depth to bedrock and groundwater. These investigations should include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(d)[1][a]">[a]</span> A partial topographic survey of the area. This map should show the proposed fill area, property boundaries, proposed site boundary, soil borings performed and wells installed. The minimum scale should be one inch equals 500 feet with the contour interval sufficient to show site relief. It is recommended that this map consist of a blowup of a USGS map (7 1/2 or 15 minute topographical), with supplemental information added as appropriate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(d)[1][b]">[b]</span> Soil borings extending to bedrock or 25 feet below the anticipated site base grade, whichever is less. The borings should be distributed in a grid pattern throughout the area. A minimum of five borings is recommended.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(d)[1][c]">[c]</span> Three of the borings should be developed into groundwater observation wells where groundwater is within 25 feet of the anticipated base grade. Otherwise, one of the borings should be extended to 50 feet below the anticipated base grade or to groundwater or bedrock, whichever is less, and an observation well established.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-5 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(d)[1][d]">[d]</span> Each major soil layer encountered during boring investigations should be analyzed for grain-size distribution and classified according to the unified soil classifications systems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(d)[2]">[2]</span> The results of the subsurface investigations should be summarized utilizing a series of geologic sections which connect the soil borings performed. Each section should show present topography, borings, wells, major soil layers, water table and bedrock.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(e)">(e)</span> Data analysis. The results of the field investigations, regional geotechnical information and land use information should be analyzed and preliminary conclusions and recommendations on site development made. This should include a discussion of the potential for the site to meet the locational requirements in Subsection C and potential limitations on site development.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(f)">(f)</span> Appendix. The site boundaries should be shown on all maps included in the appendix. The appendix should include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(f)[1]">[1]</span> All raw data, such as boring logs, soil tests, well construction data and water level measurements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(f)[2]">[2]</span> A plat map of the area.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(f)[3]">[3]</span> A USGS quadrangle of the area, updated with locations of applicable wells installed after preparation of the quadrangle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(f)[4]">[4]</span> A Natural Resources Conservation Service soil map and interpretation, if available.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)">(1)</span> No person shall establish or construct a land disposal site or facility or expand an existing site or facility without first obtaining approval of a feasibility report describing the physical conditions of the proposed site and subsequently obtaining approval of a plan of operation from the Tribe. The purpose of the feasibility report is to determine whether the site has potential for use as a solid waste disposal facility and to identify any conditions which the applicant must include in the plan of operation. The feasibility report shall be submitted in accordance with § 504-14A.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)">(2)</span> For sites for the disposal of only municipal solid waste having a proposed capacity of 30,000 cubic yards or less, an initial site report prepared in accordance with Subsection E(2) shall qualify as a complete feasibility report. Sites for the disposal of industrial or commercial solid waste having a proposed capacity of 30,000 cubic yards or less may utilize the initial site report in lieu of a complete feasibility report depending upon the waste type to be disposed and the disposal location. Such allowance shall be at the discretion of the Tribe.
