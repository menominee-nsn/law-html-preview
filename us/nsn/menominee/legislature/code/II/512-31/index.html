Discharges composed entirely of stormwater are not stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity if there is no exposure of industrial materials and activities to rain, snow, snowmelt and/or runoff and the discharger satisfies all conditions. "No exposure" means that all industrial materials and activities are protected by a storm-resistant shelter to prevent exposure to rain, snow, snowmelt and/or runoff. Industrial materials or activities include, but are not limited to, material handling equipment or activities, industrial machinery, raw materials, intermediate products, by-products, final products, or waste products. Material handling activities include the storage, loading and unloading, transportation, or conveyance of any raw material, intermediate product, final product or waste product.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(a)">(a)</span> Qualification. To qualify for this exclusion, the operator of the discharge must:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(a)[1]">[1]</span> Provide a storm-resistant shelter to protect industrial materials and activities from exposure to rain, snow, snowmelt, and runoff;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(a)[2]">[2]</span> Complete and sign (according to 40 CFR 122.22) a certification that there are no discharges of stormwater contaminated by exposure to industrial materials and activities from the entire facility;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(a)[3]">[3]</span> Submit the signed certification to the NPDES permitting authority once every five years;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(a)[4]">[4]</span> Allow the Director to inspect the facility to determine compliance with the "no exposure" conditions;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(a)[5]">[5]</span> Allow the Director to make any "no exposure" inspection reports available to the public upon request; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(a)[6]">[6]</span> For facilities that discharge through an MS4, upon request, submit a copy of the certification of no exposure to the MS4 operator, as well as allow inspection and public reporting by the MS4 operator.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(b)">(b)</span> Industrial materials and activities not requiring storm-resistant shelter. To qualify for this exclusion, a storm-resistant shelter is not required for:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(b)[1]">[1]</span> Drums, barrels, tanks, and similar containers that are tightly sealed, provided that those containers are not deteriorated and do not leak ("sealed" means banded or otherwise secured and without operational taps or valves);</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(b)[2]">[2]</span> Adequately maintained vehicles used in material handling; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(c)[1]">[1]</span> Stormwater discharges from construction are not eligible for this conditional exclusion.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(c)[2]">[2]</span> This conditional exclusion from the requirement for a NPDES permit is available on a facility-wide basis only, not for individual outfalls. If a facility has some discharges of stormwater that would otherwise be "no exposure" discharges, individual permit requirements should be adjusted accordingly.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(c)[3]">[3]</span> If circumstances change and industrial materials or activities become exposed to rain, snow, snowmelt, and/or runoff, the conditions for this exclusion no longer apply. In such cases, the discharge becomes subject to enforcement for unpermitted discharge. Any conditionally exempt discharger who anticipates changes in circumstances should apply for and obtain permit authorization prior to the change of circumstances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(c)[4]">[4]</span> Notwithstanding the provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/512-31#(6)(7)(c)[4]" title="">this subsection</a>, the NPDES permitting authority retains the authority to require permit authorization (and deny this exclusion) upon making a determination that the discharge causes, has a reasonable potential to cause, or contributes to an in-stream excursion above an applicable water quality standard, including designated uses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(6)(7)(d)">(d)</span> Certification. The "no exposure" certification must require the submission of the following information, at a minimum, to aid the NPDES permitting authority in determining if the facility qualifies for the "no exposure" exclusion:</p>

                <p>I certify under penalty of law that I have read and understand the eligibility requirements for claiming a condition of no exposure and obtaining an exclusion from NPDES stormwater permitting and that there are no discharges of stormwater contaminated by exposure to industrial activities or materials from the industrial facility identified in this document. I understand that I am obligated to submit a no exposure certification form once every five years to the NPDES permitting authority and, if requested, to the operator of the local MS4 into which this facility discharges (where applicable). I understand that I must allow the NPDES permitting authority, or MS4 operator where the discharge is into the local MS4, to perform inspections to confirm the condition of no exposure and to make such inspection reports publicly available upon request. I understand that I must obtain coverage under a NPDES permit prior to any point source discharge of stormwater from the facility. I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information submitted. Based upon my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system, or those persons directly involved in gathering the information, the information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief true, accurate and complete. I am aware there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.</p>
