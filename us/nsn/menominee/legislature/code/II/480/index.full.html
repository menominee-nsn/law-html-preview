                <p>After providing proper notice canceling or terminating a tenant's tenancy, as set forth in Article III of this Code, a tenant may be evicted from any premises, ordered to pay damages and costs, or otherwise be subject to the order or judgment of the Tribal Court for the breach of any obligation under this Code, any agreement, including an agreement to purchase or rent any dwelling, or for any other obligation provided by law. The following shall be grounds for eviction:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/480-18#A.">A.</span> Expiration of the lease. Generally, once a lease expires, whether written or oral, year to year, or month to month, the landlord is under no obligation to renew it. Occupation of any premises without permission or agreement, following any reasonable demand by a person in authority over the premises to leave.</p>

Any agreement in rent, costs, or damages which have been due and owing for 30 calendar days or more shall be cause for eviction. The receipt by a landlord of partial payments under an agreement shall not excuse the payment of any balance due upon demand. If the tenant pays the balance due during a grace period, they cannot be evicted for nonpayment; however, if repeated late payments occur within a six-month period, it shall be cause for eviction as nonpayment of rent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/480-18#C.">C.</span> Illegal conduct or serious nuisance. Breach of covenant per § 480-7F, Covenant, illegal conduct, or serious nuisance; an assault on a landlord or other tenant; use of the leased premises for selling, using or manufacturing illegal drugs, or other illegal conduct shall be cause for eviction. Serious nuisance, intentional or reckless damage, destruction, or injury to the property of the landlord or other tenants, or disturbing another tenant's right to peaceful and quiet enjoyment of a dwelling unit shall be cause for eviction. Tenants cannot cure an eviction based on breach of § 480-7F, Covenant, illegal conduct, or serious nuisance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/480-18#D.">D.</span> Breach of other lease terms. Serious or repeated violations of the material terms of the rental agreement, any reasonable rules or regulations adopted by the landlord, or any applicable building or housing codes, or other terms in the rental agreement which do not conflict with the provisions of this Code shall be cause for eviction. If the tenant cures the breach within 15 calendar days of the notice of the breach, it nullifies the breach, unless a similar breach occurs within the following six months. All parties are responsible to document breaches and cured breaches.</p>
