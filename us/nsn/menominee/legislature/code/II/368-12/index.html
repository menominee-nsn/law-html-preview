                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Legal obligation to support children. It is the legal, as well as moral, responsibility of parents to provide financially for their children's food, clothing, shelter, medical care and general well-being. A parent with legal custody or with whom the child resides at least 60% of the time is presumed to be carrying out this obligation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Child support actions. In addition to any criminal charge which may be instituted against a parent for failure to support his/her child, an action to compel payment of support may be brought by:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> The custodial parent;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> A nonlegally responsible relative; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)">(3)</span> The Child Support Agency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Procedure for child support actions. A child support action is a civil proceeding, subject to the provisions of the Tribal Judiciary and Interim Law and Order Code for the appropriate notice and hearing requirements.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="note-3" href="#footnote-3" aria-labelledby="footnote-3">3</a></p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Amount of child support; state percentage standard. After hearing, the Court shall order either or both parents to pay an amount reasonable and necessary to carry out the obligation of supporting the children. It is a rebuttable presumption that the amount of support ordered utilizing the percentage standard established by the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, as that may from time to time be amended, is the reasonable and necessary amount required, unless a party requests a modification of that standard.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Factors for modification of standard. The party requesting modification of the Wisconsin standard shall demonstrate that its application is unfair to the child or any of the parties. Such demonstration shall be based on the following factors:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(1)">(1)</span> The financial resources of the child;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)">(2)</span> The financial resources of both parents, including property received pursuant to a divorce decree;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(3)">(3)</span> Maintenance/alimony received by either parent;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(4)">(4)</span> The needs of each parent in order to support him/herself at a level equal to or greater than the federal poverty income standards;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)">(2)</span> The needs of any person, other than the child, whom either parent is legally obligated to support;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(3)">(3)</span> The desirability that the custodian remain in the home as a full-time parent;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(4)">(4)</span> The cost of day care if the custodian works outside the home or the value of custodial services performed by the custodian if the custodian remains in the home;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(5)">(5)</span> The award of substantial periods of physical placement to both parents;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(6)">(6)</span> Extraordinary travel expenses incurred in exercising the right to visitation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(7)">(7)</span> The physical, mental and emotional health needs of the child, including any costs for health insurance;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)">(8)</span> The child's educational needs;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(9)">(9)</span> The tax consequences to each parent;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(10)">(10)</span> The best interests of the child;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(11)">(11)</span> The earning capacity of each parent, based on each parent's education, training and work experience and the availability of work in or near the parent's community of residence;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(12)">(12)</span> The recommendation, if any, of the Child Support Agency;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(13)">(13)</span> The cost of substitute care ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(14)">(14)</span> Any other factors deemed relevant by the Court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Order deviating from standard for support. Upon determination that the application of the standard for support would be unfair to the child or a parent, the Court may enter an order of support which establishes an amount which differs from said standard, which includes findings of fact supporting its determination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> Payment of support orders; administrative fee. The order of support shall provide that all payments made thereunder shall be made to the Child Support Agency. The first such payment shall include an administrative fee of $35; said administration fee shall be included for each 12 months for which the support order is in effect, including any modification to the initial order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H.">H.</span> Health insurance as component of support. In addition to a monthly payment of support, the Court may require one or both parents to obtain and maintain health care coverage that is available to them, as a benefit of employment, for the benefit of the minor children until each has graduated from high school.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I.">I.</span> Child Support Agency notification. Each order for support shall be transmitted to the Child Support Agency by the Clerk and shall include a requirement that the parties keep said Agency informed of and provide notice within 10 days of any change in any of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I.(1)">(1)</span> Current address;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I.(2)">(2)</span> Current source of income and any change in income source or amount;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I.(3)">(3)</span> Any change in availability of health insurance coverage through employment, including the name of the insurance company, health care organization or health maintenance organization, the policy or certificate or contract number, and the names and birth dates of the persons for whom health care coverage is maintained; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I.(4)">(4)</span> Any change in custody of the child for whom support is ordered.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J.">J.</span> Order for parent determined unable to pay support. In any case in which child support is sought or enforcement of an existing child support order is requested, the Court may, if the parent is found to be unemployed and financially unable to pay support, order said parent to do any or all of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J.(1)">(1)</span> Register for work at a public employment office operated by the Tribe or the State of Wisconsin;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J.(2)">(2)</span> Apply for work;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J.(3)">(3)</span> Participate in job training programs; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J.(4)">(4)</span> Pursue an accredited course of instruction leading to the acquisition of a high school diploma or its equivalent; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J.(5)">(5)</span> Authorize a parent determined unable to pay support in cash to provide in lieu thereof goods and/or services, the value of which is validated by the Child Support Agency and the usefulness of which is affirmed in writing by the child's custodian. The continued appropriateness of an authorized in lieu contribution shall be reviewed by the Tribal Court every 90 days that such an order is in effect.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K.">K.</span> Order for income withholding. In the absence of a finding of good cause not to issue an order for income withholding, the Court shall issue, in addition to its order of support, an order directed and served on the payer's employer to withhold from the payer's wages and salary and pay to the Child Support Agency as child support an amount which is the lesser total of the following: the child support amount ordered by the Court or the amount allowed under Section 303(b) of Title III of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, P.L. 90-321, 15 U.S.C. § 1673(b). The Child Support Agency shall provide the employer with the notification of income withholding and the forms necessary to comply with the order of withholding.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L.">L.</span> Modification of child support order. The Court may, upon application by the parties, the Child Support Agency, or Department of Social Services and due notice to the opposite party, revise and alter any judgment or order respecting the amount of child support which is subject to enforcement by the Court, upon a finding of substantial change of circumstances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(1)">(1)</span> Circumstances presumed to be substantial. Any of the following constitute a rebuttable presumption of a substantial change of circumstances sufficient to justify a revision of the support judgement or order:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(1)(a)">(a)</span> Commencement of receipt of temporary assistance for needy families by either parent since the entry of the last child support order.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(1)(b)">(b)</span> The expiration of 33 months after the date of entry of the last child support order, unless the amount of child support was expressed as a percentage of parental income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(1)(c)">(c)</span> Failure of the payer to furnish a timely disclosure of assets.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(2)">(2)</span> Circumstances which may be substantial. Any of the following may constitute a substantial change in circumstances sufficient to justify a revision of the support judgment or order:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(2)(a)">(a)</span> Unless the amount of child support was expressed as a percentage of parental income, a change in the payer's income.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(2)(b)">(b)</span> Change in the needs of the child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(2)(c)">(c)</span> Change in the payer's earning capacity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(2)(d)">(d)</span> Any other factor determined relevant by the Court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="L.(3)">(3)</span> Circumstances not a basis for modification. Violation of physical placement rights by the custodian does not constitute reason for modification of child support obligations.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M.">M.</span> Enforcement of child support order. An order for child support by the Menominee Tribal Court, or an order of any other Court with personal and subject matter jurisdiction, may be enforced by the Tribal Court by any of the following proceedings:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="M.(1)">(1)</span> An order to show cause requiring the payer to demonstrate at a reasonable time therein specified why the payer should not be held in contempt and subject to:</p>
