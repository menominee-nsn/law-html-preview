                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> Closure. The owner of a site or facility for the land disposal of solid waste shall submit, as part of the initial operating license application and annually thereafter for the period of active facility life, proof of financial responsibility to ensure compliance with the closure requirements of the facility's approval plan of operation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> Long-term care. The owner of a site or facility for the disposal of solid waste shall be responsible for the long-term care of the facility for either 20 or 30 years after facility closure, unless the owner's responsibility is terminated earlier by approval from the Tribe. An owner responsible for long-term care shall specify at the time of submittal of the plan of operation whether the owner chooses to be responsible for 20 years, subject to tribal approval, or 30 years and shall submit, as part of the initial operating license application and annually thereafter for the period of active facility life, proof of financial responsibility to ensure compliance with the long-term care requirements of the plan of operation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)">(3)</span> Successors in interest. Any person acquiring rights of ownership, possession or operation of a licensed facility shall be subject to all requirements of the license for the facility and shall provide any required proof of financial responsibility to the Tribe in accordance with this section.

To provide proof of financial responsibility the applicant shall use one of the following methods for each account:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)">(1)</span> Performance or forfeiture bond.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)(a)">(a)</span> If the owner chooses to submit a bond, it shall be in the amount determined according to Subsection E(2) and conditioned upon faithful performance by the owner and successor in interest of all closure requirements of the approved plan of operation or, if no approved plan of operation exists for the site, all applicable requirements in Subsection G. The bond shall be delivered to the Tribe as part of an initial operating license application. Bond forms shall be supplied by the Tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)(b)">(b)</span> Bonds shall be issued by a surety company authorized to do surety business in Wisconsin. At the option of the owner, a performance bond or a forfeiture bond may be filed and the Tribe shall be the obligee of the bond. Surety companies may have the opportunity to complete the closure of the site in lieu of cash payment to the Tribe if the owner or any successor in interest fails to carry out the closure requirements of the approved plan of operation, or the applicable requirements in § 504-20L. The Tribe shall mail notification of its intent to use the funds for that purpose to last known address for the owner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)(c)">(c)</span> Each bond shall provide that as long as any obligation of the owner for closure remains, the bond may not be cancelled by the surety, unless a replacement bond or other proof of financial responsibility under this subsection is provided to the Tribe by the owner. If the surety proposes to cancel such a bond, the surety shall provide notice to the Tribe in writing by registered or certified mail not less than 90 days prior to the proposed cancellation date. Not less than 30 days prior to the expiration of the ninety-day notice period, the owner shall deliver to the Tribe a replacement bond or other proof of financial responsibility under this subsection, in the absence of which all generation, recycling and accumulation operations shall immediately cease, and the bond shall remain in effect as long as any obligation of the owner remains for closure.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)(d)">(d)</span> If the surety company becomes bankrupt or insolvent or its authorization to do business in the state is revoked or suspended, the owner shall, within 30 days after receiving written notice thereof, deliver to the Tribe a replacement bond or other proof of financial responsibility under this subsection, in the absence of which all generation, recycling and accumulation operation shall immediately cease, and the bond shall remain in effect as long as any obligation of the owner remains for closure.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(2)">(2)</span> Deposit with the Tribe. An owner may deposit cash, certificates of deposit, or United States government securities with the Tribe. The amount of the deposit shall be determined according to Subsection E(1) and shall be submitted as part of an initial operating license application. Cash deposits placed with the Tribe shall be segregated and invested in an interest-bearing account. All interest pavements shall be accumulated in the account. The Tribe shall have the right to use part or all of the funds to carry out the closure or requirements of the approved plan of operation or the applicable requirements in § 504-20L if the owner fails to do so. The Tribe shall mail notification of its intent to use funds for that purpose to the last known address of the owner.</p>

The assets in the escrow account shall consist of cash, certificates of deposit, or United States government securities. All interest payments shall be accumulated in the account. A duplicate original of the escrow agreement with original signatures shall be submitted to the Tribe as part of an initial operating license application. Escrow account forms shall be supplied by the Tribe. The Tribe shall be a party to the escrow agreement, which shall provide that there shall be no withdrawals from the escrow account except as authorized in writing by the Tribe. The escrow agreement shall further provide that the Tribe shall have the right to withdraw and use part or all of the funds in the escrow account to carry out the closure or requirements of the approved plan of operation or the applicable requirements in § 504-20L if the owner fails to do so. The Tribe shall mail notification of its intent to use funds for that purpose to the last known address of the owner.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(4)">(4)</span> Irrevocable trust. If the owner creates an irrevocable trust, it shall be exclusively for the purpose of ensuring that the owner or any successor in interest will comply with the closure requirements of the approved plan of operation or, if no approved plan of operation exists for the facility, the applicable requirements in § 504-20L. The trust agreement shall designate the Tribe as sole beneficiary. The trustee shall be a bank or other financial institution located within the State of Wisconsin which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated and examined by the state or a federal agency. The trust corpus shall consist of cash, certificates of deposit or United States government securities in the amount determined according to Subsection E(1). All interest payments shall be accumulated in the account. A duplicate original of the trust agreement with original signatures shall be submitted to the Tribe for approval as part of an initial operating license application.

The Tribe shall mail notifications of its intent to use funds for that purpose to the last known address of the owner.</p>

The owner of a facility for the land disposal of solid waste shall prepare a new closure cost estimate whenever a substantial change in the closure plan affects the cost of closure and a new long-term care cost requirement in the approved plan of operation affects the cost of long-term care. Proof of the increase in the amount of all bonds, letters of credit, escrow accounts and trust accounts, or other approved methods established under this section shall be submitted annually to the Tribe. The Tribe may adjust the amount of the required proof of financial responsibility for closure or long-term care based upon prevailing or projected interest and inflation rates and the latest cost estimates and may annually require the owner to adjust the amount of proof of financial responsibility accordingly.</p>

Whenever, on the basis of any reliable information and after opportunity for a hearing, the Tribe determines that an owner or operator of a solid waste land disposal facility is in violation of any of the requirements for closure or long-term care specified in the approved plan of operation, the Tribe shall have the right to enter upon the facility and carry out the closure or long-term care requirements. The Tribe may use part or all the money deposited with it, or the money deposited in escrow or trust accounts, or performance or forfeiture bonds, or letters of credit, or funds accumulated under other approved methods to carry out the closure or long-term care requirements.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I.(1)">(1)</span> Closure. When an owner or operator has completed closure, the owner may apply to the Tribe for release of the bond, insurance or the letter of credit or return of the money held on deposit, in escrow, or in trust for closure of the facility. The application shall be accompanied by an itemized list of costs incurred. Upon determination by the Tribe that complete closure has been accomplished, the Tribe shall authorize in writing the release and return of all funds accumulated in such accounts or give written permission for cancellation of the bond or letter of credit. Determination shall be made within 90 days of the application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="I.(2)">(2)</span> Long-term care. One year after closure, and annually thereafter for the period of owner responsibility, the owner who has carried out all necessary long-term care during the preceding year may make application to the Tribe for reimbursement from an escrow account, trust account, or deposit with the Tribe, or other approved methods, or for reduction of the bond, insurance or letter of credit equal to the estimated costs for long-term care for that year. The application shall be accompanied by an itemized list of cost incurred. Upon determination that the expenditures incurred are in accordance with the long-term care requirement anticipated in the approved plan of operation, the Tribe may authorize, in writing, the release of the funds or approve a reduction in the bond or letter of credit. Prior to authorizing a release of the funds or a reduction of the bond or letter of credit, the Tribe shall determine that adequate funds exist to complete required long-term care work for the remaining period of owner responsibility. Determination shall be made within 90 days of the application. Any funds remaining in an escrow account, trust, account, or on deposit with the Tribe at the termination of the period of owner responsibility shall be released to the owner.</p>
