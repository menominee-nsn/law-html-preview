                <p>Water uses designated herein shall be protected and water quality and quantity shall be maintained at present and/or natural conditions in order to protect and maintain designated, existing, and other beneficial uses of tribal waters. Criteria listed in Article V shall be used as standards to protect water quality, drinking water sources, fish, wildlife and aquatic life, human health, cultural, ceremonial, religious, and spiritual uses, habitat and natural food chain maintenance, and other consumptive and nonconsumptive designated, existing, and other beneficial uses. All waters of the Reservation will be protected to support the following designated uses:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Fish, wildlife and aquatic life use. All waters of the Reservation are designated to provide for the protection and propagation of balanced ecosystems for indigenous fish (as well as rainbow trout and kokanee salmon), wildlife and aquatic life, including wild rice (Zizania aquatica), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), and other plants and animals, and the protection of human health from disease related to consumption of fish, wildlife, and aquatic life, as well as the protection of these organisms from disease. All streams and rivers of the Reservation are further designated to provide a self-sustaining trout fishery, in addition to certain lakes marked with a "(T)" in Article III. The following ecosystems and their associated uses shall be protected:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)">(1)</span> Cold water ecosystems. These ecosystems include surface waters capable of supporting a community of cold water fish and other aquatic life, or serving as a spawning area and or overwintering area for cold water fish species, including trout (Salmonidae), sculpins (Cottidae), and certain minnow (Cyprinidae) species. This category shall apply to all streams and rivers of the Reservation, except (lower) portions of the Wolf River as noted in Subsection A(2) below, and to lakes that are marked with a "(T)" in Article III.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)">(2)</span> Warm water ecosystems. These ecosystems include surface waters capable of supporting a community of warm water sport fish or that serve as spawning areas for warm water sport fish. This designation shall apply to all lakes of the Reservation, with the exception of lakes that are marked with a "(T)" in Article III, and portions of the Wolf River during certain times of year because the river will support both warm and cold water fish.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(3)">(3)</span> Wetlands. These ecosystems include areas that are defined as such and may include wild rice beds. Article IV of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/512" title="Chapter 512 SURFACE WATER">this chapter</a> provides additional language regarding wetlands.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Recreation use. All waters of the Reservation are designated for full-body recreational use, which necessitates primary contact with the water, including underwater swimming and incidental ingestion of water through participation in the recreational activity. Recreational uses also include white water rafting, canoeing, fishing, and wading, and other uses.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Ceremonial, religious and spiritual use. All waters of the Reservation are used for ceremonial and spiritual purposes by tribal members (and descendants). The Tribe holds water sacred, and our historic past epitomizes this statement. The original five clans of the Menominee, consisting of the Bear, Eagle, Wolf, Crane, and Moose, depended on water to sustain life and used water to perform their ceremonial responsibilities. Additional historic and modern ceremonial uses of water include, but are not limited to, uses in the annual Sturgeon Ceremony, wild rice harvest, and the harvesting of medicinal plants from waters of the Reservation. Traditional religious use of water in Big Drum Ceremonies, the sweat lodge, and other ceremonies is (still) practiced today. These uses may involve, among other things, primary direct contact, drinking and inhalation of water. Recognizing the ceremonial and traditional use of water and its life-giving properties is important for the spiritual significance of the Menominee people.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Cultural use. All waters of the Reservation, and aquatic natural resources, are designated for historic, traditional, and cultural uses. Cultural water uses encompass all ethnohydrological uses of water associated with unique Menominee ways of life. These uses include, but are not limited to, the ethnobotanical harvest and medicinal use of numerous plants associated with aquatic, wetland, and riparian habitats, as well as basic socioeconomic uses of waters of the Reservation for sustenance. Aquatic plants that grow in waters of the Reservation are vital to continuation of Menominee culture through the use of those plants for medicinal purposes by Menominee people.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)">(1)</span> All living things on the Menominee Reservation in some way use the waters of the Reservation to sustain life. People, animals, birds, plants, trees, and insects use water and have their place in Menominee culture.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)">(2)</span> Waters of the Reservation shall be maintained and protected in such an ecological condition that will allow (traditional) Menominee educational uses associated with waters of the Reservation to continue perpetually.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(3)">(3)</span> Cultural educational uses shall include, but not be limited to, ethnohydrological learning experiences that are passed from one generation to the next regarding the harvest of plants and animals. Culturally, to the Menominee people, waters of the Reservation are as significant as the forest ecosystem and will continue to be regarded with the same deference. The Tribe protects the forest ecosystem with sustained yield forestry management practices; this same (everlasting) treatment shall be afforded waters of the Reservation, for it is the very essence of sustaining life which is critical to maintaining the culture of the Menominee people. Cultural uses are very significant to the Tribe, indigenous forest-dwelling people that have for more than five millennia relied upon the water in the Tribe's historic range to sustain unique Menominee ways of life.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Fish and wildlife habitat and natural food chain maintenance use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(1)">(1)</span> All waters, and aquatic and riparian ecosystems, of the Reservation are designated for wildlife habitat and natural food chain maintenance. Naturally occurring food chains/webs shall be maintained, including but not limited to predator-prey relationships, browsing and grazing strategies, and symbiotic relationships related to food acquisition. The Tribe realizes direct benefits from this usage, including specific and general ecological benefits, consumptive and nonconsumptive environmental and natural resource uses, including but not limited to the taking of fish, furbearers, waterfowl, wild rice, and other aquatic life for human consumption, and cultural, spiritual, and religious benefits and aesthetic and other legitimate benefits and uses. Menominee cultural beliefs indicate that humans fit into the natural food chain; therefore, natural food chain maintenance associated with aquatic and riparian areas must be protected and/or restored.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)">(2)</span> Waters of the Reservation shall also be protected in order to provide continued ecological support for a number of rare, threatened, endangered, and culturally significant species, including but not limited to the bald eagle (Haliaeetus luecocephalus), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), slippershell mussel (Alasmidonta viridis), blandings turtle (Emydoidea blandingii), pine marten (Martes americana), lake sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens), sandhill crane (Grus canadensis), timber wolf (Canis lupus), common loon (Gavia immer), pygmy snaketail dragonfly (Ophiogomphus howeii), Karner blue butterfly(Lycaeides melissa samuelis), Phlox moth (Schinia indiana), Missouri rock cress (Arabis missouriensis var deamii), Indian cucumber root (Medeola virginiana), pitcher plant (Sarracenia purpurea), and cranberries, among others.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Navigation use. All navigable waters of the Reservation are designated for navigational uses for tribal purposes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> Forestry use. All waters of the Reservation are designated to support a healthy forest ecosystem and to provide adequate water conditions for propagation of native tree species that are subject to Menominee sustained yield forestry management and for other agricultural purposes that befit the Tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H.">H.</span> Public drinking water supply use. All waters of the Reservation shall be protected for use as municipal public drinking water supplies. Groundwater for all other users is protected by <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/562" title="Chapter 562 WATER">Chapter 562</a>, Article I, Groundwater Quality, of this Code.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I.">I.</span> Industrial water supply use. All waters of the Reservation shall be available for regulated industrial use(s), except those waters that are designated outstanding national resource waters.</p>
