                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)(b)">(b)</span> If no interested person has petitioned within 30 days after the death of the decedent, petition for summary assignment of the estate may be made by any person who was guardian of the decedent at the time of the decedent's death, any creditor of the decedent, or anyone who has an interest in property which is or may be a part of the estate.</p>

The petition shall contain the following information, except that the petitioner may omit from the petition the information in Subsection B(2)(c) and (d) and include it in an affidavit filed with the court prior to the signing of the order assigning the estate:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)(a)">(a)</span> A statement that the estate does not exceed $200,000 in value.</p>

If a lease is included as part of the property subject to summary assignment, the petitioner must include written notice from the Tribe that the lease is not eligible for transfer pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/451-5" title="§ 451-5 Notice of inability to transfer lease or permit pursuant to this chapter.">§ 451-5</a>.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(4)">(4)</span> Bond. Before making any order, the court may require a bond of the petitioner in an amount the court deems sufficient, conditioned to indemnify any person who may be aggrieved by the order. Before assigning property, the court may require assignees to give bond for the satisfaction of their liability to creditors or persons interested in the estate.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(5)">(5)</span> Notice. As soon as practicable after filing the petition with the court, the petitioner shall give notice by certified mail to the persons listed in Subsection B2(d) and (e) and shall publish notice pursuant to Subsection I.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(6)">(6)</span> Order. If the court is satisfied that the estate may be settled by this section, after filing of the petition and after 30 days have elapsed since notice under Subsection B(5), it shall decide all claims in accordance with Subsection G, and assign the property to the creditors and persons who are entitled to it pursuant to a will, if any, or, in the absence of a will, pursuant to the rules of intestate succession pursuant to Subsection H. The assignment shall be subject to the unknown rights of creditors of the estate and interested persons as limited in Subsection F.

It shall order the transfer of interests in real estate, stocks or bonds registered in the name of the decedent, the title of a licensed motor vehicle or any other form of property. If the decedent immediately prior to death had an estate for life or an interest as a joint tenant in any property in regard to which a certificate of termination has not been issued, the order shall set forth the termination of the life estate or the right of survivorship of any joint tenant. Every tract of real property in which an interest is assigned or terminated or which is security for a debt in which an interest is assigned or terminated shall be specifically described.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Recording required. Whenever the order relates to an interest in real property or to a debt which is secured by an interest in real property, a certified copy or duplicate original of the order shall be recorded by the petitioner in the office of the register of deeds in each county in which the real property is located, and, in regard to any lease, with the real estate office of the Tribe.</p>

Creditors and interested persons who were not assigned the property to which they were entitled from the estate may recover against those assignees, or their respective bondsmen whose assigned shares have been increased by reason of the fact that the creditor or person interested was not assigned the share of the estate to which the creditor or person interested was entitled. No assignee or assignee's bondsman shall be liable for an amount greater than the value of the property which was assigned to the assignee from the estate, the value to be determined as of the time of the assignment. No action for the recovery of any property assigned in the proceeding or for the value of such property shall be brought by any creditor more than three months after the publication pursuant to Subsection J. No action for the recovery of any property assigned in the proceeding or for the value of such property may be brought by any person interested more than three months after a copy of the order assigning the estate was mailed or delivered to the person, or, if the person's name or post-office address could not have been ascertained by the exercise of reasonable diligence on the part of the petitioner, then more than three months after publication of notice pursuant to Subsection J.</p>
