                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)(d)">(d)</span> The guardian has a strong commitment to caring permanently for the child;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)(e)">(e)</span> The guardian is licensed as the child's foster parent and the guardian and all adults residing in the guardian's home meet the requirements for licensing; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)(f)">(f)</span> Prior to being named as the guardian of the child, the guardian entered into a subsidized guardianship agreement with the Department.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Duration of eligibility. Subsidized guardianship payments may be continued after the child attains 18 years of age if any of the following applies:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)">(1)</span> The child is under 19 years of age, is a full-time student at a secondary school or its vocational or technical equivalent, and is reasonably expected to complete the program before reaching 19 years of age;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(2)">(2)</span> The child is under 21 years of age, is a full-time student at a secondary school or its vocational or technical equivalent, has a mental or physical disability that warrants the continuation of those payments as determined by the Department, is not eligible for social security disability insurance and otherwise lacks adequate resources to continue in secondary school or its vocational or technical equivalent; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(3)">(3)</span> The child is under 21 years of age, is a full-time student at a secondary school or its vocational or technical equivalent, an individualized education program is in effect for the child, and the subsidized guardianship agreement for the child became effective on or after the date on which the child attained 16 years of age.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Subsidized guardianship agreement. Before the Department may approve the provision of subsidized guardianship payments to a proposed guardian, the Department shall negotiate and enter into a written, a binding subsidized guardianship agreement with the proposed guardian and provide the proposed guardian with a copy of the agreement. A subsidized guardianship agreement or an amended subsidized guardianship agreement may also name a prospective successor guardian of the child to assume the duty and authority of guardianship on the death or incapacity of the guardian. A successor guardian is eligible for monthly subsidized guardianship payments under this section only if the successor guardian is named as a prospective successor guardian of the child in a subsidized guardianship agreement or amended subsidized guardianship agreement that was entered into before the death or incapacity of the guardian, the conditions specified for a successor guardian are met, and the Court appoints the successor guardian to assume the duty and authority of guardianship as provided.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)">(1)</span> A subsidized guardianship agreement shall specify all of the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(a)">(a)</span> The amount of the monthly subsidized guardianship payments that will be provided under the agreement and the manner in which those payments may be adjusted periodically, in consultation with the guardian, based on the circumstances of the guardian and the needs of the child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(b)">(b)</span> Any additional services and assistance for which the child or guardian will be eligible under the agreement, a description of those additional services and that additional assistance, and the procedures by which the guardian may apply for those additional services and that additional assistance.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(c)">(c)</span> Who will pay the total cost of the nonrecurring expenses that are associated with obtaining guardianship of the child, not to exceed $2,000.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(d)">(d)</span> That the agreement shall remain in effect without regard to the state of residence of the guardian.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(e)">(e)</span> That, in determining eligibility for adoption assistance for the care of the child, the placement of the child in the home of the guardian and any payments made shall be considered never to have been made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Payments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(1)">(1)</span> The Department shall determine the initial amount of a monthly payment for the care of a child based on the circumstances of the guardian and the needs of the child. That amount may not exceed the amount received under foster care by the guardian of the child for the month immediately preceding the month in which the guardianship order was granted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)">(2)</span> If a person who is receiving monthly subsidized guardianship payments under an agreement believes that there has been a substantial change in circumstances, as defined by the Department by promulgated rule, he or she may request that the agreement be amended to increase the amount of those payments. If a request is received, the Department shall determine whether there has been a substantial change in circumstances and whether there has been a substantiated report of abuse or neglect of the child by the person receiving those payments. If there has been a substantial change in circumstances and if there has been no substantiated report of abuse or neglect of the child by that person, the Department shall offer to increase the amount of those payments based on criteria established by the Department promulgated rules. If an increased monthly subsidized guardianship payment is agreed to by the person receiving those payments, the Department shall amend the agreement in writing to specify the increased amount of those payments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(3)">(3)</span> Annually, the Department shall review an agreement that has been amended to determine whether the substantial change in circumstances that was the basis for amending the agreement continues to exist. If that substantial change in circumstances continues to exist, the agreement, as amended, shall remain in effect. If that substantial change in circumstances no longer exists, the Department shall offer to decrease the amount of the monthly subsidized guardianship payments provided based on criteria established by the Department. If the decreased amount of those payments is agreed to by the person receiving those payments, the Department shall amend the agreement in writing to specify the decreased amount of those payments. If the decreased amount of those payments is not agreed to by the person receiving those payments, that person may appeal the decision of the Department regarding the decrease.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(4)">(4)</span> A department may propose to a person receiving monthly subsidized guardianship payments that the agreement be amended to adjust the amount of those payments. If an adjustment in the amount of those payments is agreed to by the person receiving those payments, the agreement shall be amended in writing to specify the adjusted amount of those payments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(5)">(5)</span> An agreement may be amended more than once.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(6)">(6)</span> The Department may recover an overpayment made from a guardian or interim caretaker who continues to receive those payments by reducing the amount of the person's monthly payment. The Department may by rule specify other methods for recovering those overpayments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(7)">(7)</span> Annual review. The Department shall review a placement of a child for which the Department makes payments not less than every 12 months after the Department begins making those payments to determine whether the child and the guardian remain eligible for those payments. If the child or the guardian is no longer eligible for those payments, the Department shall discontinue making those payments.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)">(8)</span> Appeal.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)(a)">(a)</span> Any person whose application for payments is not acted on promptly or is denied on the grounds that a condition has not been met and any person whose payments are decreased or discontinued may petition the Department for a review of that action or failure to act. Review is unavailable if the action or failure to act arose more than 45 days before submission of the petition for review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)(b)">(b)</span> Upon receipt of a timely petition, the Department shall give the applicant or recipient reasonable notice and an opportunity for a review of the appeal. The Department may make such additional investigation as it considers necessary. Notice of the review hearing shall be given to the applicant or recipient and to the Department whose action or failure to act is the subject of the petition. The Department may be represented at the hearing. The Department shall render its decision as soon as possible after the hearing and shall send a certified copy of its decision to the applicant or recipient and to the Department whose action or failure to act is the subject of the petition. The decision of the Department shall have the same effect as an order of the Department whose action or failure to act is the subject of the petition. The decision shall be final, but may be revoked or modified as altered conditions may require.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)(c)">(c)</span> The Department shall deny a petition for review or shall refuse to grant relief if any of the following applies:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)(c)[1]">[1]</span> The petitioner withdraws the petition in writing;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)(c)[2]">[2]</span> The sole issue in the petition concerns an automatic payment adjustment or change that affects an entire class of recipients and is the result of a change in rule or law; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)(c)[3]">[3]</span> The petitioner abandons the petition. Abandonment occurs if the petitioner fails to appear in person or by a representative at a scheduled hearing without good cause, as determined by the Department.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(8)(d)">(d)</span> If a recipient requests a hearing within 10 days after the date of notice that his or her</p>
