                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Acknowledgement of paternity. The paternity of any child may be established through the signing of a statement by the father and mother of the child before the Clerk of Tribal Court. The acknowledgement statement shall identify the father and mother by birth date, social security number, and residence and shall likewise so identify the child. Upon receipt of such statement, witnessed by the Clerk, a Judge of the Menominee Tribal Court may enter an order of filiation and refer the matter to the Child Support Agency for a recommendation as to child support and the initiation of a child support proceeding. If the child is an Indian child who may qualify for enrollment in the Menominee Tribe of Wisconsin, the Menominee Tribal Court shall be further required to conduct a hearing pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/69" title="Chapter 69 ENROLLMENT">Chapter 69</a>, Enrollment, of this Code, and the Court may then enter an order of filiation and refer the matter to the Child Support Agency for a recommendation as to child support and the initiation of a child support proceeding.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Initiation of paternity determination. The Menominee Tribal Court may entertain a petition to determine the paternity of a child filed by:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> The child;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> The child's biological mother;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)">(3)</span> A man alleged or alleging himself to be the child's father;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(4)">(4)</span> The custodian of the child; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(5)">(5)</span> The Child Support Agency.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Time for filing paternity action. If a petition to determine paternity is brought before the birth of the child, no hearing shall be conducted until after the birth, unless the Court shall determine that any action is necessary in order to preserve testimony. If a petition to determine paternity is brought more than 20 years after the birth of the child and the alleged father is deceased, the Court may dismiss the petition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Content of petition. A petition to determine paternity may be joined with a request to order child support under § 368-12B above. It shall state the name and date of birth of the child if born, or that the mother is pregnant if the child is unborn, the name of any alleged father, whether any party has filed an action to determine paternity in any other court, and if a judgment of paternity has been rendered by any other court. The petition shall also give notice of a party's right to request a genetic test under Subsection N herein.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Paternity adjudication necessary for determination of father's rights. The Menominee Tribal Court shall decline to issue an order for child support, physical placement or legal custody unless the man has been adjudicated or has acknowledged paternity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Summons. The summons to be served, along with the petition, shall include the following notice, in addition to providing a time and date for appearance:</p>
                <p>Notice to Respondent</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.1.">1.</span> You have been named in a petition alleging paternity. A judgment of paternity would legally designate the child as your child, grant parental rights to you, create the right of inheritance for the child, obligate you to pay child support until the child reaches the age of 18 or until the child graduates from high school or its equivalent up to age 19, and make your failure to pay child support punishable by contempt of court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.2.">2.</span> You may request genetic tests which will indicate the probability that you are or are not the father of the child. The Court will order genetic tests on request by you, the Child Support Agency, or any other party. Any person who refuses to take Court-ordered genetic tests may be punished for contempt of court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.3.">3.</span> The petitioner has the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that you are the father. If genetic tests show that you are not excluded as the father and that the statistical probability of your being the father is 99.0% or higher, you are rebuttably presumed to be the father.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.4.">4.</span> The following defenses are available to you:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F.4.(a)">(a)</span> That you were sterile or impotent at the time of conception;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F.4.(b)">(b)</span> That you did not have sexual intercourse with the mother of the child during the conceptive period; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F.4.(c)">(c)</span> That another man did have sexual intercourse with the mother of the child during the conceptive period.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.5.">5.</span> If you fail to appear at any stage of the proceeding, including a scheduled genetic test, the Court may enter a default judgment finding you to be the father. A default judgment will take effect 30 days after it is served on or mailed to you, unless within those 30 days you present to the Court good cause for your failure to appear or present yourself for the genetic test. You need not appear at the time and place specified in the summons if you complete the enclosed waiver of first appearance statement and deliver it to the Court by the date specified in the waiver statement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> Time of first appearance. The first appearance may not be held any sooner than 30 days after service or receipt of the summons and petition, unless the parties agree that first appearance may be held in less time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H.">H.</span> Waiver of first appearance. The respondent may waive first appearance if he signs a statement which reads substantially as follows:</p>
                <p>Waiver of First Appearance</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.1.">1.</span> I understand that by signing this waiver and agreeing to its terms I am not required to appear at the time and place specified in the summons. If I do not sign this statement, I am required to appear at the time and place specified.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.2.">2.</span> I understand that I will be notified by the Court of all future stages of the proceeding and agree to appear at those stages. If I fail to appear at any stage, including a scheduled genetic test, the Court may enter a default judgment against me.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.3.">3.</span> I enter the following plea:</p>
                <p>I agree that I am the child's father.</p>
                <p>I deny that I am the child's father.</p>
                <p>I agree that I am the child's father, subject to the confirmation by a genetic test.</p>
                <p>If I enter a plea agreeing that I am the child's father, a judgment of paternity will be entered against me. If I enter a plea denying that I am the child's father, or a plea agreeing that I am the child's father subject to a genetic test, I agree to undergo a genetic test.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.4.">4.</span> This waiver of first appearance is valid only if delivered	to	the	Court	on	or	before</p>
                <p>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.5.">5.</span> I will keep the Menominee Tribal Child Support Agency informed of my address at all times. The following is my current address:</p>
                <p>Respondent</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I.">I.</span> First appearance. At the first appearance, the Court shall inform the parties of the legal consequences of paternity, as described in the summons contents in Subsection F, and shall order all parties to submit to genetic tests and/or enter a judgment of paternity if admitted by the alleged father on the waiver of first appearance statement. In the event that a judgment is entered, the Court shall schedule a hearing on child support.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J.">J.</span> Hearings on contested paternity. When the alleged father denies paternity, the Court shall determine whether the case should proceed formally or informally.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J.(1)">(1)</span> Informal hearing. At an informal hearing, the Court may hear witnesses presented by the parties and, based upon that evidence, recommend that the action be dismissed, that the alleged father voluntarily admit paternity, and that the alleged father agree to provide support and have granted reasonable and liberal rights of visitation and/or physical placement and, if the parties agree to the recommendations, enter an order of paternity and support.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="J.(2)">(2)</span> Formal hearing. The petitioner must demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the alleged father is in fact the child's father. Upon a determination that the petitioner has met this burden, the Court shall then determine child support, legal custody, periods of physical placement and like matters.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K.">K.</span> Testimony relating to paternity.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="K.(1)">(1)</span> In any hearing relating to paternity, evidence may include, but is not limited to:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K.(1)(a)">(a)</span> Evidence of sexual intercourse between the mother and alleged father at any possible time of conception or evidence of a relationship between the mother and alleged father at any time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K.(1)(b)">(b)</span> An expert's opinion concerning the statistical probability of the alleged father's paternity based upon the duration of the mother's pregnancy.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K.(1)(c)">(c)</span> Genetic test results.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="K.(1)(d)">(d)</span> The statistical probability of the alleged father's paternity based upon the genetic tests.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L.">L.</span> Judgment of paternity after failure to appear. If a respondent is the alleged father and fails to appear at any time not waived by the Court, the Court may, if there is no good cause to contrary, enter an order adjudicating the respondent to be the father and enter appropriate orders for support, legal custody and physical placement, which shall be served on the respondent or mailed by registered or certified mail to his last known address. Such order shall take effect 30 days after service unless, with that time, the respondent presents to the Court evidence of good cause for his failure to appear or to undergo a genetic test.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M.">M.</span> Reopening default judgment of paternity. A default judgment adjudicating a person to be the father of a child may be reopened upon petition for good cause shown.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N.">N.</span> Genetic tests in paternity actions. Any genetic test ordered by the Court in a paternity action is subject to this section. A genetic test must be ordered in any action in which the petitioner is an adult and seeks to establish the identity of his/her father.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N.(1)">(1)</span> Persons to be tested. The Court may, and upon request of any party shall, require the child, mother, any male for whom there is probable cause to believe that he had sexual intercourse with the mother during a possible time for the child's conception, or any male witness who will testify or testifies as to his sexual relations with the mother to submit to genetic tests. Probable cause may be established by the petition of an affidavit from the child's mother or after examination under oath of a complainant or witness.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N.(2)">(2)</span> Genetic test administration and evidence. Any ordered genetic test shall be performed by an expert qualified as an examiner of genetic markers present on blood cells and components appointed by the Court. A report completed and certified by the expert stating genetic test results and the statistical probability of the alleged father's paternity based upon the genetic tests is admissible as evidence without expert testimony and may be entered into the record at any hearing if, at least 10 days prior to the hearing, the party offering the report files it with the Court, with notice to the other parties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N.(3)">(3)</span> Genetic test results; presumption. If the ordered genetic tests show that the alleged father is not excluded and that the statistical probability of the alleged father's paternity is 99.0% or greater, the alleged father is rebuttably presumed to be the child's parent.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N.(4)">(4)</span> Genetic test exclusion. Whenever the results of the genetic tests exclude the alleged father as the father of the child, this evidence shall be conclusive evidence of nonpaternity, and the Court shall dismiss the action. Whenever the results of the tests exclude any male witness from possible paternity, the tests shall be conclusive evidence of nonpaternity of the male witness.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="N.(5)">(5)</span> Costs of genetic tests. The fees and costs of genetic tests shall be paid by the Child Support Agency, which may seek federal reimbursement through the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, Menominee County, or from either the mother or father, if one or both have sufficient resources to pay the costs of genetic test. Fees and costs of such tests shall be paid by the child seeking to establish the identity of his/her father when such child is 18 years of age or older.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="O.">O.</span> Judgment of paternity. The judgment or order of the Court determining the existence or nonexistence of paternity is determinative for all purposes. If paternity is found to exist, the order may contain any other provision appropriate, including the duty of support, the legal custody and guardianship of the child, periods of physical placement, or any other matter in the best interests of the child. Unless the Court specifically orders otherwise, the mother shall have sole legal custody of the child. Any order of support shall comply with the provisions of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/368-12" title="§ 368-12 Child support.">§ 368-12</a> of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/368/III" title="Article III Financial Support of Children">this article</a>.</p>
