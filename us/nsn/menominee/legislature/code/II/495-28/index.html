                <p>The rules, regulations, and sewer rates of the Menominee Department of Tribal Utilities of the Menominee Indian Tribe hereinafter set forth shall be considered a part of the contract with every person, company or corporation who or which is connected with the sewer system of the Menominee Tribe, and every such person, company, or corporation by connecting with the sewer system shall be considered as expressing his or its assent to be bound thereby. Whenever any of said rules and regulations, or such others as said Department of Tribal Utilities of the Menominee Tribe may hereafter adopt, are violated, the service shall be shut off from the building or place of such violation (even though two or more parties are receiving service through the same connection) and shall not be reestablished except by order of the Director of Tribal Utilities and on payment of all arrears and the expenses and established charges of shutting off and putting on and such other terms as the Director of Tribal Utilities shall determine, and a satisfactory understanding with the party that no further cause for complaint shall arise. In case of such violation, said Director of Tribal Utilities, furthermore, may declare any payment made for the service by the party or parties committing such violation to be forfeited, and the same shall thereupon be forfeited. The right is reserved to the Menominee Department of Tribal Utilities with approval from the Menominee Tribal Legislature by motion to change said rules, regulations, and sewer rates from time to time as it may deem advisable and to make special rates and contracts in all proper cases.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Plumbers. No plumber, pipe fitter, or other person will be permitted to do any plumbing or pipe fitting work in connection with the sewer system without first receiving written permission from the Menominee Department of Tribal Utilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Users.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> Application for service.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)(a)">(a)</span> Every person connecting with the sewer system shall file an application in writing with the Department of Tribal Utilities on such form as is prescribed for that purpose. Blanks for such applications will be furnished at the Office of Tribal Utilities. The application must state fully and truly all the uses which will be allowed except upon further application and permission regularly obtained from said Department. If the applicant is not the owner of the premises, the written consent of the owner must accompany the application. The application may be for service to more than one building, or more than one unit of service through one service connection, and in such case charges shall be made accordingly.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)(b)">(b)</span> If it appears that the service applied for will not provide adequate service for the contemplated use, the Department of Tribal Utilities may reject the application. If the Department of Tribal Utilities shall approve the application, it shall issue a permit for the services as shown on the application.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> Payment for connection application. Prior to the issuance of the application for service all users shall pay the connection fee listed in the Schedule of Rates and Fees of the Menominee Department of Tribal Utilities.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)">(3)</span> Tap permits. After sewer connections have been introduced into any building or upon any premises, no plumber shall make any alterations, extensions, or attachments unless the party ordering such tapping or other work shall exhibit the proper permit.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(4)">(4)</span> User to keep in repair. All users shall keep their own service pipes in good repair and protected from frost, at their own risk and expense, and shall prevent any unnecessary overburdening of the sewer system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(5)">(5)</span> User use only. No user shall allow others or other services to connect to the sewer system through his or its lateral.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(6)">(6)</span> User to permit inspection. Every user shall permit the Department of Tribal Utilities and its employees or authorized agents, at all reasonable hours of the day, to enter his or its premises or building to examine the pipes and fixtures and the manner in which the drains and sewer connections operate, and the user must at all times, frankly and without concealment, answer all questions put to him or it relative to its use.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(7)">(7)</span> Responsibility. It is expressly stipulated that no claim shall be made against the Menominee Tribe or the Menominee Department of Tribal Utilities, or any officers, employees or agents thereof, by reason of the breaking, clogging, stoppage or freezing of any service pipes, nor from any damage arising from repairing mains, making connections or extensions or any other work that may be deemed necessary. The right is hereby reserved to cut off the service at any time for the purpose of repairs or any other necessary purpose, any permit granted or regulation to the contrary notwithstanding. Whenever it shall become necessary to shut off the sewer service, the Department of Tribal Utilities shall, if practicable, give notice to each and every user affected of the time when such service will be so shut off.</p>
