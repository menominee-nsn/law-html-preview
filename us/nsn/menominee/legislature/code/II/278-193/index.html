The pattern may be chronic and pervasive, or in some situations stimulated by the parental use of alcohol or drugs. Emotional maltreatment may coexist with or be a consequence of physical or sexual abuse, but it also can exist as a separate event. "Emotional maltreatment" may include, but is not limited to, the following: a child whose social relationships are seriously impaired, and/or a child with very low self-esteem, or a consistent pattern of emotional difficulties such as listlessness, apathy, depression, or self-deprecating remarks; a child who does not appropriately respond to normal adult behavior (e.g., cowering or ingratiating himself or herself to adults behaving normally); a child who is rejected or whose parent, guardian, or caretaker refuses to accept him or her; a child whose parent, guardian, or caretaker ignores him or her or deprives him or her of essential responsiveness which stifles emotional growth and development; a child who is severely intimidated, ridiculed or terrorized by verbally assaulting, bullying, name calling, destroying possessions, or attacking pets or beloved people of that child; a child who is isolated from normal social experiences, prevented from forming friendships, or locked out of the home; a child who is taught socially deviant behavior, such as by rewarding aggression, delinquency, or sexual behavior; a child who is penalized for positive or normal behavior; or an infant who is failing to thrive as a result of the parent or discouraged from forming an attachment with his or her caregiver; or</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> "Active efforts" means:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> To provide affirmative, active, thorough, and timely efforts and rehabilitative and/or remedial services intended primarily to maintain or reunite an Indian child with his or her family. Active efforts help ensure that parents receive the services they need so that they can be safely reunited with their children and to ensure that services are provided that would permit the Indian child remain or be reunited with parents, whenever possible. To help protect against unwarranted removals by ensuring that parents who are, or may readily become, fit parents are provided with services necessary to retain or regain custody of their child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> In the event reunification is not possible, active efforts to place the child with family members or other placements in accordance with the highest placement preferences for the child to achieve permanency must be made.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)">(3)</span> The Court may not order the child to be removed from the home of the child's parent or legal custodian and placed in out-of-home care placement unless it has been shown that there has been an affirmative, active, thorough, timely, ongoing, vigorous and concerted level of casework and that the active efforts were made in a manner that takes into account the prevailing social and cultural values, conditions and way of life of the child's Tribe and that utilizes the available resources of the child's Tribe, tribal and other Indian child welfare agencies, extended family members of the child, or other individual Indian caregivers and other culturally appropriate service providers. The Court shall consider whether all of the following activities were conducted in determining whether active efforts were made:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(a)">(a)</span> Representatives designated by the Indian child's tribe with substantial knowledge of the prevailing social and cultural standards and child-rearing practice within the tribal community were requested to evaluate the circumstances of the Indian child's family and to assist in developing a case plan that uses the resources of the tribe and of the Indian community, including traditional and customary support, actions, and services, to address those circumstances.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(b)">(b)</span> A comprehensive assessment of the situation of the Indian child's family was completed, including a determination of the likelihood of protecting the Indian child's health, safety, and welfare effectively in the Indian child's home.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(c)">(c)</span> Representatives of the Indian child's tribe were identified, notified, and invited to participate in all aspects of the Indian child custody proceeding at the earliest possible point in the proceeding and their advice was actively solicited throughout the proceeding. <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/278-193#B.(3)(c)" title="">This subsection</a> is not required for Menominee children.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(d)">(d)</span> Extended family members of the Indian child, including extended family members who were identified by the Indian child's tribe or parents, were notified and consulted with to identify and provide family structure and support for the Indian child, to assure cultural connections, and to serve as placement resources for the Indian child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(e)">(e)</span> Arrangements were made to provide natural and unsupervised family interaction in the most natural setting that can ensure the Indian child's safety, as appropriate to the goals of the Indian child's permanency plan, including arrangements for transportation and other assistance to enable family members to participate in that interaction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(f)">(f)</span> All available family preservation strategies were offered or employed and the involvement of the Indian child's tribe was requested to identify those strategies and to ensure that those strategies are culturally appropriate to the Indian child's tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(g)">(g)</span> Community resources offering housing, financial, and transportation assistance and in home support services, in-home intensive treatment services, community support services, and specialized services for members of the Indian child's family with special needs were identified, information about those resources was provided to the Indian child's family, and the Indian child's family was actively assisted or offered active assistance in accessing those resources.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(h)">(h)</span> Monitoring of client progress and client participation in services was provided.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(i)">(i)</span> A consideration of alternative ways of addressing the needs of the Indian child's family was provided, if services did not exist or if existing services were not available to the family.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(4)">(4)</span> If any of the activities specified above were not conducted, the person seeking the out-of-home care placement or involuntary termination of parental rights shall submit documentation to the Court explaining why the activity was not conducted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(5)">(5)</span> The Court should not rely solely on past findings regarding the sufficiency of the active efforts, but rather, should routinely ask as part of the proceedings whether circumstances have changed and whether additional active efforts have been or should have been provided.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(6)">(6)</span> It is the burden of the petitioning party to prove active efforts have been made through evidence, testimony, and qualified expert witnesses. The burden of proof shall be by clear and convincing evidence except for suspension of parental rights or termination of parental rights for which the burden shall be beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(7)">(7)</span> Prior to ordering an out-of-home placement, an involuntary foster-care placement, or suspension or termination of parental rights, the Court must conclude that active efforts have been made to prevent the breakup of the family and that those efforts have been unsuccessful with findings on the record and documented in their orders.</p>
