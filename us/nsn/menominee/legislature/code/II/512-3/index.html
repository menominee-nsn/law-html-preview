                <p>The Tribe may promulgate new rules or amend rules governing facilities, practices or activities if the Tribe determines that the amendment or promulgation of such rules is necessary to protect waters of the Reservation, aquatic life, public health, safety or welfare, and designated and existing uses and to achieve the goals of these standards. The Tribe shall review and, if appropriate, revise the water quality regulations at any time, or at least on a triennial basis, and hold public hearings for the purpose of reviewing and revising applicable water quality standards. The requirements of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/512" title="Chapter 512 SURFACE WATER">this chapter</a> are in addition to the requirements of any other chapters, rules, and ordinances established by the Tribe.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)">(1)</span> Public notification. The Department will provide no less than 30 days' notice to the public in advance of agency action to permit time for public response.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)">(2)</span> Public consultations. This includes but is not limited to public hearings, public meetings, and advisory groups. The Department will provide a timely distribution of information sufficiently in advance of decisionmaking to assimilate the public views on the Department's action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)(a)">(a)</span> Public hearings. Notice of public hearings, whether mandatory or discretionary, shall be publicized and mailed to interested and affected parties at least 45 days prior to the date of the hearing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)(a)[1]">[1]</span> However, where the Department determines that there are no substantial documents that must be reviewed for effective hearing participation and that there are no complex or controversial matters to be addressed by the hearing, the notice requirement may be reduced to no less than 30 days.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)(a)[2]">[2]</span> The Department may further reduce or waive the hearing notice requirement in emergency situations where the Department or Legislature determines that there is an imminent danger to public health.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)(a)[3]">[3]</span> Reports, documents and data relevant to the discussion at the public hearing shall be available to the public at least 30 days before the hearing. Materials relevant to the hearing that will further assist public participation may be made available earlier.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="note-1" href="#footnote-1" aria-labelledby="footnote-1">1</a></p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)(b)">(b)</span> Public meetings. Public meetings are any assemblies or gatherings (such as conferences, informational sessions, seminars, workshops, or other activities) which the Department intends to be open to anyone wishing to attend. The requirements of Subsection A(2) are applicable to public meetings, except that the Department may reduce notification of public meetings to no less than 30 days, if there is good reason that longer notice cannot be provided.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)(c)">(c)</span> Responsiveness summaries. The Department shall prepare responsiveness summaries at specific decision points in program regulations or in the approved public participation work plan. Responsiveness summaries are also required for rule-making activities. Each responsiveness summary shall identify the public participation activity conducted; describe the matters on which the public was consulted; summarize the public's views, significant comments, criticisms and suggestions; and set forth the Department's specific responses in terms of modifications of the proposed action or an explanation for rejection of proposals made by the public. Responsiveness summaries shall also include evaluations by the Department of the effectiveness of the public participation program and evaluations from any advisory group and provide an opportunity for other participating members of the public to contribute to the evaluation. (In the case of programs with multiple responsiveness summary requirements, these analyses need only be prepared and submitted with the final summary required.) Lastly, responsiveness summaries shall be forwarded to the appropriate decisionmaking official and shall be made available to the public.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Notice of intention to adopt rules and opportunity to submit data. Any proposed changes or revisions to these standards shall be preceded by a public notice posted at the Neopit and the Keshena post offices, County Courthouse and Tribal Office Building; additionally, all requirements of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/177" title="Chapter 177 POSTING PROCEDURES">Chapter 177</a>, Posting Procedures, of this Code shall be met, and a copy of the notice shall be mailed to all persons who have made timely request to the committee or the Department for information regarding the proposed rule-making proceedings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)">(1)</span> Such notice shall include:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)(a)">(a)</span> Reference to the authority under which the rule is proposed;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)(b)">(b)</span> A statement of either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)(c)">(c)</span> The time, place, and manner in which interested persons may present their views thereon.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)">(2)</span> All interested persons should be given a reasonable opportunity to submit data, views, or arguments in writing. Opportunity for a public hearing may be granted if requested in a timely manner and determined by the Legislature to be in the public interest. The Legislature shall fully consider all oral comments and written submissions prior to making its final determination.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(3)">(3)</span> No regulatory proceedings shall be held on any final rule until 20 days have passed from the posting date in which notice is given of the adoption of said rule by the Tribal Legislature. This regulatory proceeding is in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, Bylaw II, Section 2(d).</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(4)">(4)</span> No rule hereafter adopted is valid unless adopted in substantial compliance with this section or, if an emergency rule designated as such, adopted in compliance with Subsection C. In any proceeding, a rule cannot be contested on the grounds of noncompliance with the procedural requirements of this section, as now or hereafter amended, after one year has elapsed from the effective date of the rule.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Emergency rules and amendments. If a committee or the Department recommends, and the Tribal Legislature so finds, that immediate adoption or amendment of a rule is necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, or general welfare of the Reservation population, and that observance of the requirements of notice and opportunity to present views on the proposed action would be contrary to the public interest, the Legislature may dispense with such requirements and immediately adopt the rule or amendment as an emergency rule or amendment. The Legislature finding and a brief statement of the reasons for its finding shall be incorporated in the emergency rule or amendment. An emergency rule or amendment shall not remain in effect for longer than 60 days after adoption. This regulatory proceeding is in accordance with the Constitution and Bylaws of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin, Bylaw II, Section 2(g).</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)">(1)</span> The Legislature shall file with the Chairperson, the presiding officer of the Tribal Legislature, a true copy of all rules now in effect and being implemented. The Chairperson shall keep a permanent register of such rules and all rules subsequently adopted by the Legislature. This permanent register shall be open to public inspection during normal business hours.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(2)">(2)</span> Emergency rules shall become effective upon their adoption by the Legislature. All other rules hereafter shall become effective upon the expiration of 20 days following their publication, unless a later date is required by applicable law or specified in the rule.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Statement of purpose of rules and how implemented.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)">(1)</span> When a committee or the Department proposes that the Legislature take action to adopt a rule, the sponsoring committee shall ensure that the proposed rule is accompanied by a statement which generally describes the purpose of the proposed rule and how to implement it.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)">(2)</span> Upon filing the proposed rule with the Chairperson, the sponsoring committee shall have copies of all statements on file and available for public inspection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Petition for adoption, amendment, or repeal of rules. Any interested person may petition a committee and request that such committee propose that the Legislature promulgate, amend, or repeal any rule. With in 60 days after the submission of the petition, or at the next regular meeting of the committee if it does not meet within this sixty-day period, the committee shall formally consider the petition and within 30 days thereafter shall either deny the petition in writing (stating the reason for the denial) or initiate rule-making proceedings.</p>
