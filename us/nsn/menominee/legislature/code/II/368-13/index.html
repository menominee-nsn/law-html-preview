                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> Upon request of the custodial parent or nonlegally responsible relative and the request is based upon the failure or refusal of a parent to provide for the support of his/her child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> Upon notification by the Department of Social Services or any other public agency providing public aid to a spouse or minor child and the notice is based on the:</p>

Said payment shall not be made to a licensed foster parent of the child.</p>
