                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Acting under Court order or voluntary agreement, the child's parent, guardian, or Indian custodian, or the Department, a county department, or a child welfare agency licensed to place children in foster homes or group homes may place a child or negotiate or act as intermediary for the placement of a child in a foster home or group home. Voluntary agreements under this subsection may not be used for placements in facilities other than foster homes or group homes and may not be extended. A foster home placement under a voluntary agreement may not exceed 180 days from the date on which the child was removed from the home under the voluntary agreement. A group home placement under a voluntary agreement may not exceed 15 days from the date on which the child was removed from the home under the voluntary agreement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Acting under a voluntary agreement, a child's parent, guardian, or Indian custodian, the Department, a county department, or a child welfare agency licensed to place children in shelter care facilities may place the child or negotiate or act as intermediary for the placement of the child in a shelter care facility that the Department has approved for use for placements under this subsection. A voluntary agreement under this subsection may not be used for placement in a facility other than an approved shelter care facility. A shelter care facility placement under a voluntary agreement may not exceed 20 days from the date on which the child was placed in the shelter care facility under the voluntary agreement and may not be extended.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Voluntary agreements shall be in writing and shall specifically state that the agreement may be terminated at any time by the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian or by the child if the child's consent to the agreement is required. In the case of an Indian child who is placed by the voluntary agreement of the Indian child's parent or Indian custodian, the voluntary consent of the parent or Indian custodian to the placement shall be given. The child's consent to an agreement is required whenever the child is 12 years of age or older.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> If a county department or the Department places a child or negotiates or acts as intermediary for the placement of a child, the voluntary agreement shall also specifically state that the county department or department has placement and care responsibility for the child as required under 42 U.S.C. 672(a)(2) and has primary responsibility for providing services to the child.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> No person may place a child or offer or hold himself or herself out as able to place a child, except as provided in this section. Enrollment of a child by a parent or guardian in an educational institution and delegation of care and custody of a child to an agent do not constitute a placement for the purposes of this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Voluntary placements do not apply to the placement of a child for adoption. Adoptive placements shall be made pursuant to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/278" title="Chapter 278 CHILDREN'S CODE">this chapter</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> A permanency plan is required for each child placed in a foster home. If the child is living in a foster home under a voluntary agreement, the agency that negotiated or acted as intermediary for the placement shall prepare the permanency plan within 60 days after the date on which the child was removed from his or her home under the voluntary agreement. A copy of each plan shall be provided to the child if he or she is 12 years of age or over and to the child's parent, guardian, or Indian custodian. If the agency that arranged the voluntary placement intends to seek a Court order to place the child outside of his or her home at the expiration of the voluntary placement, the agency shall prepare a revised permanency plan and file that revised plan with the Court prior to the date of the hearing on the proposed placement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H.">H.</span> If a child who is at least 14 years of age, who is a custodial parent, or an expectant mother, and who is in need of a safe and structured living arrangement and the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian of the child consent, a child welfare agency licensed to place children in group homes may place the child or arrange the placement of the child in a group home. Before placing a child or arranging the placement of a child under this subsection, the child welfare agency shall report any suspected abuse or neglect of the child. A voluntary agreement to place a child in a group home may be made only under this subsection, shall be in writing, and shall specifically state that the agreement may be terminated at any time by the parent, guardian, Indian custodian, or child. In the case of an Indian child who is placed in a group home under this subsection by the voluntary agreement of the Indian child's parent or Indian custodian, the voluntary consent of the parent or Indian custodian to the placement shall be given. An initial placement under this subsection may not exceed 180 days from the date on which the child was removed from the home under the voluntary agreement, but may be extended an additional 180 days. An initial placement under this subsection of a child who is under 16 years of age on the date of the initial placement may be extended as provided no more than one time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I.">I.</span> A permanency plan is required for each child placed in a group home and for any child of that child who is residing with that child. The agency that placed the child or that arranged the placement of the child shall prepare the plan within 60 days after the date on which the child was removed from his or her home under the voluntary agreement and shall provide a copy of the plan to the child and the child's parent, guardian, or Indian custodian.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J.">J.</span> If the Department or agency that has placed a child or that has arranged the placement of the child wishes to extend the placement of the child, the agency shall prepare a revised permanency plan for that child and for any child of that child who is residing with that child and submit the revised permanency plan or plans, together with a request for a review of the revised permanency plan or plans and the child's placement, to the Court before the expiration of the child's placement. The request shall include a statement that an extension of the child's placement would be in the best interests of the child, together with reliable and credible information in support of that statement, a statement that the child and the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian of the child consent to the extension of the child's placement, and a request that the Court approve an extension of the child's placement. On receipt of a revised permanency plan or plans and a request for review, the Court shall set a time and place for the review and shall advise the agency that placed the child or that arranged the placement of the child of the time and place of the review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K.">K.</span> Not less than 10 days before the review, the Department or agency that placed the child or that arranged the placement of the child shall provide a copy of the revised permanency plan or plans and the request for review and notice of the time and place of the review to the child, the parent, guardian, Indian custodian, and legal custodian of the child, and the operator of the group home in which the child is placed, together with notice of the issues to be determined as part of the permanency review and notice of the fact that those persons shall have a right to be heard at the review by submitting written comments to the Court before the review or by participating at the review.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L.">L.</span> At the review, any party to the case may present information relevant to the issue of extension and information relevant to the determinations of the Court. After receiving that information, the Court shall make the determinations required for permanency plan review and whether an extension of the child's placement is in the best interests of the child and whether the child and the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian of the child consent to the extension. If the Court determines that the extension is in the best interests of the child and that the child and the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian of the child consent to the extension, the Court shall approve, in writing, an extension of the placement for a specified period of time not to exceed six months, stating the reason for the approval, and the agency that placed the child or that arranged the placement of the child may extend the child's placement for the period of time approved. If the Court determines that the extension is not in the best interests of the child or that the child and the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian of the child do not consent to the extension, the Court shall, in writing, disapprove an extension of the placement, stating the reason for the disapproval, and the agency that placed the child or that arranged the placement of the child may not extend the placement of the child past the expiration date of the voluntary placement unless the agency obtains a Court order placing the child in the group home after the expiration date of the voluntary placement. Notwithstanding the approval of an extension under this subdivision, the child or the parent, guardian, or Indian custodian of the child may terminate the placement at any time during the extension period.</p>
