                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Preservice training. In order to prepare teachers who will share with parents their aspirations for the maintenance of the Menominee language and culture, the Menominee Nation encourages all schools of education at nearby colleges and universities to provide preservice training in Menominee language theory and methodology for teachers preparing to teach Menominee children. Schools of education are encouraged to provide appropriate preservice training toward the understanding and appreciation of the Menominee language and culture so that teachers can knowledgeably teach appropriate curricula. The Menominee Language and Culture Code Commission and/or Curriculum Director will provide consultation to cooperating institutions regarding Menominee learning styles and appropriate teaching strategies which will prepare the potential teacher of Menominee children with competencies in teaching.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Professional development training with the Menominee Language and Culture Commission.

All teachers are required to perform the following duties in furtherance of this goal:</p>

All certified language teachers are required to meet with fluent speakers of the Menominee language as scheduled by the Menominee Language and Culture Commission.

These sessions are mandatory for all teachers and shall be held as scheduled at the offices of the Menominee Language and Culture Commission. Teachers are required to attend the entire session and bring their lexicon and English to Menominee booklet. Teachers will be notified by telephone and letter of each mandatory session. Each teacher's employer will be sent a copy of these meeting notices, and a record of attendance for each teacher shall be kept in his or her file. Teachers are required to submit lesson plans to the Director of the Menominee Language and Culture Commission at said weekly meetings. All lesson plans must comply with any adopted or proposed curriculum approved by the Menominee Language and Culture Commission.
