                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> The Department, upon registering a motor vehicle, shall issue to the applicant two registration plates for an automobile, truck, or motor home, and one plate for other motor vehicles.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> In lieu of issuing a new plate upon each renewal of registration or a motor vehicle, the Department may issue a tag, decal, or other identification per motor vehicle to indicate the period of registration. The tag, decal, or other identification shall be used only if the outstanding plate is in suitable condition for further usage.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> The Department shall determine the size, color, and design of registration plates with a view toward making the following visible: the period for which the motor vehicle is registered and the fee class into which the motor vehicle falls. The registration plates shall also be a ready means of identifying the specific motor vehicle or owner for which the plates were issued.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> All registration plates shall have displayed upon them the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)">(1)</span> The registration number assigned to the motor vehicle or owner. The registration number may be composed of numbers, letters, or both.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(1)">(1)</span> The Department may issue the following special plates:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(1)(a)">(a)</span> Disabled person plates. If a registrant submits a statement once every four years, from a physician licensed to practice medicine in any state, or from a chiropractor licensed to practice chiropractic services in any state, that the registrant is a person with a disability that limits or impairs the ability to walk, the Department shall issue or renew plates of a special design in lieu of plates which ordinarily would be issued for the motor vehicle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(1)(b)">(b)</span> Veterans plates. The Department shall issue special plates for veterans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(1)(c)">(c)</span> Other special plates.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)">(2)</span> If an individual in possession of special plates no longer qualifies for the special plates, the individual shall:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)(b)">(b)</span> Submit an application and registration fee for plates he or she qualifies for and pay a fee for the issuance of replacement plates.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Antique motor vehicle plates. A motor vehicle which has a model year of 1945 or earlier and which has not been altered or modified from the original manufacturers' specifications may register the vehicle as an antique motor vehicle upon payment of a fee, and be furnished registration plates of a distinctive design, in lieu of the usual registration plates, which shall show, in addition to the requirements of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/550-39" title="§ 550-39 Design, procurement, and issuance of registration plates.">§ 550-39</a>D(1) through (3), that the motor vehicle is an antique. The registration shall be valid while the motor vehicle is owned by the applicant without payment of any additional fee.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(1)">(1)</span> Any person who registers an antique motor vehicle may furnish and display on the motor vehicle a historical plate from or representing the model year of the motor vehicle if the registration and plates issued by the Department are simultaneously carried in the motor vehicle and are available for inspection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(2)">(2)</span> Unless inconsistent with this section, the provisions applicable to other motor vehicles apply to antique motor vehicles.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="G.(3)(c)">(c)</span> No special-interest vehicle may be operated upon any highway during the month of January unless the owner of the vehicle reregisters the vehicle with regular registration plates or transfers regular registration plates to the vehicle.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G.(4)">(4)</span> Unless inconsistent with this section, the provisions applicable to other vehicles shall apply to special-interest vehicles.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(1)">(1)</span> The Department shall issue personalized registration plates only upon request and if:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(1)(a)">(a)</span> The request is accompanied by the proper fee and paperwork as required by the Department; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(1)(b)">(b)</span> The requested combination of numbers, letters, or both has not already been issued.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(2)">(2)</span> The Department may refuse to issue any combination of letters, numbers, or both which carry connotations offensive to Menominee heritage or traditions, good taste or decency, or which would be misleading, or in conflict with the issuance of any other registration plates.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(3)">(3)</span> Each personalized registration plate issued shall be reserved for the recipient in succeeding registration periods and shall not be duplicated for issuance to any other person if the recipient maintains the plate, unless the recipient authorizes issuance of the plate to another person. If the recipient does not maintain the plate for two successive years or if the recipient does not specifically request reissuance of the personalized registration plate by the end of the month in which the plate expires, the Department may reissue the personalized registration plate to another applicant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(4)">(4)</span> The Department may cancel and order the return of any personalized registration plates issued which contain any combination of letters, numbers, or both, which the Department determines may carry connotations that are offensive to Menominee heritage or traditions, good taste and decency, or which may be misleading. Any person ordered to return such plate shall either be reimbursed for any additional fees they paid for the plates for the registration year in which they are recalled, or be given at no additional cost replacement personalized registration plates, the issuance of which is in compliance with <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/550/VII" title="Article VII Motor Vehicle Registration [Adopted 3-5-2020 by Ord.
