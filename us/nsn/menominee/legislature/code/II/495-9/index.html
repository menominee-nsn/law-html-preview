                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> General. Site evaluation shall be conducted by a soil tester certified by the Wisconsin Department of Commerce in accord with Ch. Comm 5, Wis Adm. Code. The evaluation shall include soil conditions, properties and permeability, depth to zones of soil saturation, depth to bedrock, slope, landscape position, all setback requirements and the potential for flooding. Soil test data shall relate to the undisturbed elevations, and a vertical elevation reference point or benchmark must be established. Evaluation data shall be reported on forms provided by the Wisconsin Department of Commerce and signed by the certified soil tester. Reports shall be filed for all sites investigated within 30 days of the completion of testing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Replacement system area.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> General. On each parcel of land being initially developed, sufficient area of suitable soils, based on the soil tests and system location and site requirement contained in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/495/I" title="Article I Private Sewage Systems [Adopted 7-6-2000 by Ord. No. 00-14]">this article</a>, for one replacement system shall be established.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> Nonconforming site conditions. The Department shall be contacted for approval of replacement systems for all public buildings and all buildings where site conditions do not permit systems in accord with <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/495/I" title="Article I Private Sewage Systems [Adopted 7-6-2000 by Ord. No. 00-14]">this article</a>. Alternates for the disposal of effluent emanating from existing structures may be accomplished by means other than those outlined in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/495/I" title="Article I Private Sewage Systems [Adopted 7-6-2000 by Ord. No. 00-14]">this article</a>, provided that detailed plans and specifications are submitted to the Department for review and consideration. Written approval shall be received from the Department prior to work commencing on these systems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)">(3)</span> Undisturbed site. The replacement system area shall not be disturbed to the extent that it is no longer a suitable system area. The replacement system area shall not be used for the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(a)">(a)</span> Construction of buildings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(b)">(b)</span> Parking lots or parking areas.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(c)">(c)</span> Below-ground swimming pools.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)(d)">(d)</span> Any other use that may adversely affect the replacement area.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Slope.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)">(1)</span> General. A conventional soil absorption system shall not be located on a land slope of greater than 20%. A conventional soil absorption system shall be located at least 20 feet from the crown of a land slope that is greater than 20% except where the top of the aggregate of a system is at or below the bottom of an adjacent roadside ditch.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(2)">(2)</span> Specific system designs. Where a more restrictive land slope is to be observed for a soil absorption system other than a conventional system, the more restrictive land slope specified in the design sections of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/II/495/I" title="Article I Private Sewage Systems [Adopted 7-6-2000 by Ord. No. 00-14]">this article</a> shall apply.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Soil borings and profile descriptions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)">(1)</span> General. Soil borings shall be conducted on all sites regardless of the type of private sewage system planned to serve the parcel. Borings shall extend at least three feet below the bottom of the proposed system. Borings shall be of sufficient size and extent to determine the soil characteristics important to on-site liquid waste disposal. Borehole data shall be used to determine the suitability of the soils at the site with respect to zones of seasonal or permanent soil saturation and the depth to bedrock. The use of power augers for soil borings is prohibited.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)">(2)</span> Number. There shall be a minimum of three suitable borings per soil absorption site. More soil borings may be necessary for accurate evaluation of a site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)(a)">(a)</span> Depth of borings. Borings shall be constructed to a depth of at least three feet below the proposed depth of the system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)(b)">(b)</span> Exceptions. On new parcels, the requirement of six borings (three for initial area and three for replacement area) may be reduced to five if the initial and replacement system areas are contiguous and one boring is made on each outer corner of the contiguous area and the fifth boring is made between the system areas.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)(c)">(c)</span> Reports. Regardless of the number of borings evaluated and conditions observed in borings, all soil information derived from borings shall be reported.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)(d)">(d)</span> Location. Each borehole location shall be accurately located and referenced to the vertical elevation and horizontal reference point. Reports of boring locations shall be either drawn to scale or have the horizontal dimensions clearly indicated between the borings and the horizontal reference point.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(3)">(3)</span> Soil descriptions. Soil profile descriptions shall be written for all borings. The thickness in inches of the different soil horizons observed shall be indicated. Horizons shall be differentiated on the basis of color, texture, soil mottles or bedrock. Depths shall be measured from the ground surface.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(4)">(4)</span> Soil mottles. Zones of seasonal or periodic soil saturation shall be estimated at the highest level of soil mottles. The Department may require a detailed description of the soil mottling on a marginal site. The abundance, size, contrast and color of the soil mottles should be described in the following manner:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(4)(a)">(a)</span> Abundance. Abundance shall be described as "few" if the mottled color occupies less than 2% of the exposed surface; "common" if the mottled color occupies from 2% to 20% of the exposed surface; or "many" if the mottled color occupies more than 20% of the exposed surface.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(4)(b)">(b)</span> Size. Size refers to the length of the mottle measured along the longest dimension and shall be described as "fine" if the mottle is less than five millimeters; "medium" if the mottle is from five millimeters to 15 millimeters; or "coarse" if the mottle is greater than five millimeters.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(4)(c)">(c)</span> Contrast. Contrast refers to the difference in color between the soil mottle and the background color of the soil and is described as "faint" if the mottle is evident but recognizable with close examination; "distinct" if the mottle is readily seen but not striking; or "prominent" if the mottle is obvious and one of the outstanding features of the horizon.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(4)(d)">(d)</span> Color. The color(s) of the mottle(s) shall be given.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(5)">(5)</span> Observed groundwater. The depth to groundwater, if present, shall be reported. Observed groundwater shall be reported at the level groundwater reached in the soil borehole or at the highest level of sidewall seepage into the boring. Measurements shall be made from ground level. Soil above the water level in the boring shall be checked for the presence of soil mottles.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)">(6)</span> Color patterns not indicative of soil saturation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)(a)">(a)</span> One-foot exception. Soil profiles that have an abrupt textural change with finer textured soils overlying more than four feet of unmottled, loamy sand or coarser soils can have a mottled zone in the finer textured material. If the mottled zone is less than 12 inches thick and is immediately above the textural change, than a soil absorption system may be installed in the loamy sand or coarser material below the mottled layer. If any soil mottles occur within the sandy material, then the site shall be unsuitable. The Department may determine certain coarse sandy loam soils to be included as a coarse material.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)(b)">(b)</span> Other soil color patterns. Soil mottles can occur that are not due to zones of seasonal or periodic soil saturation. Examples of such soil conditions, not limited by enumeration, are:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)(b)[1]">[1]</span> Soil mottles formed from residual sandstone deposits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)(b)[2]">[2]</span> Soil mottles formed from uneven weathering of glacially deposited material, or glacially deposited material that may be naturally gray in color. This may include concretionary material in various stages of decomposition.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)(b)[3]">[3]</span> Deposits of lime in a profile derived from highly calcareous parent material.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)(b)[4]">[4]</span> Light-colored silt coats deposited on soil ped faces.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)(b)[5]">[5]</span> Soil mottles that are usually vertically oriented along old or decayed root channels with a dark organic stain usually present in the center of the mottled area.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)(c)">(c)</span> Reporting exceptions. A certified soil tester shall report any mottled soil condition. If soil mottles are observed that may not be due to soil saturation, the soil tester still shall report such condition and may request a determination from the Department on the acceptability of the site.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(7)">(7)</span> Bedrock. The depth to bedrock, except sandstone, shall be established at the depth in a soil boring where greater than 50% of the weathered in-place material is consolidated. Sandstone bedrock shall be established at the depth where an increase in resistance to penetration of a knife blade occurs.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Soil evaluation for absorption systems. System sizing and siting for all soil absorption systems shall be based on soil morphological conditions specified in Subsection D and Table 1<a class="footnote-anchor" id="note-1" href="#footnote-1" aria-labelledby="footnote-1">1</a> or percolation tests conducted prior to July 1, 1994.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Percolation test results for sizing absorption systems. The sizing of soil absorption systems shall be based upon Table 2.<a class="footnote-anchor" id="note-2" href="#footnote-2" aria-labelledby="footnote-2">2</a></p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> Verification.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G.(1)">(1)</span> Borings. Depth to soil mottles, depth to high groundwater, soil textures, depth to bedrock and land slope may be subject to verification by the Department. The Department may require backhoe pits to be provided for verification of soil boring data.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="G.(2)">(2)</span> Filling. Where the natural soil condition has been altered by filling or other methods used to improve wet areas, the Department may require observation of high groundwater levels under saturated conditions.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H.">H.</span> Winter soil testing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(1)">(1)</span> General. Soil testing should be done only when weather and light conditions make accurate evaluation of site conditions possible. Soil testing attempted under winter conditions is difficult and precautions should be observed.</p>
