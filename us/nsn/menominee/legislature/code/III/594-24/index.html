                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> Maximum permissible sound levels by land use. No person shall operate or cause to be operated on private property any source of sound in such a manner as to create a sound level which exceeds the limits set forth below when measuring at or within the property boundary of the receiving land use. At all times, the sound-level limit, dBa, on trust lands shall be 70.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> Correction for character of sound. For any source of sound which emits a pure tone or impulsive sound, the maximum sound-level limits set forth in Subsection F(1) shall be reduced by five dBA.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(3)">(3)</span> Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to refuse collection vehicles, aircraft and airport operations, interstate railway locomotives and cars, and emergency signaling devices.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Method of measuring noise.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(1)">(1)</span> Equipment. Noise measurement shall be made with a sound-level meter manufactured according to the specifications of the American Standards Institute, USA Standard Specifications for General Purposes Sound Level Meters (S1.4-1971) and Preferred Center Frequencies for Acoustical Measurements (S1.6-1960) or any subsequent nationally adopted standards superseding the above standards.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(2)">(2)</span> Location and interpretation. Noise measurement shall be made at the nearest lot line of the premises from which the noise complaint(s) is received and shall be made at a height of at least three feet above the ground and at least three feet away from walls, barriers, obstructions or sound-reflective surfaces. Where the nature of the noise permits, the slow-response setting shall be used to obtain the noise level on the sound-level meter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Variance permits. Variance permits may be issued by the Department to exceed the noise standards set forth in this section as follows:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)">(1)</span> Temporary variance permits.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(a)">(a)</span> General. A temporary variance permit may be issued upon request, provided that the work producing such noise is necessary to promote the public health and/or welfare and reasonable steps are taken to keep such noise at the lowest possible practical level.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(b)">(b)</span> Special community events. A temporary variance permit may be issued for special events, such as circuses, 4th of July celebrations and similar community events, which are limited in duration and are generally acceptable to the Tribe; provided that precautions are taken to maintain the noises produced at the lowest practical level.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)">(2)</span> Procedure to obtain a variance permit. Applications for temporary variance permits must be made in writing to the Department and shall contain all of the following pertinent information:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)">(a)</span> Dates requested;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(b)">(b)</span> Time and place of operation;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(c)">(c)</span> Equipment and operation involved;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(d)">(d)</span> Necessity for such permit;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(e)">(e)</span> Steps to be taken to minimize noise; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(f)">(f)</span> Name of responsible person(s) who will be present at the operation site while the noise is produced.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)">(3)</span> Variance permits of indefinite duration.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)(a)">(a)</span> It is recognized that it is not technically or economically feasible for certain business operations and equipment to comply with the standards set forth herein as of the date of this section. The Tribe shall therefore issue a variance permit on existing business operations and equipment which produces excessive noise if it is found that it is not technically or economically feasible to alter such operation to reduce noise to within the prescribed standards set forth in this section. Applications for such variances must be made to the Department by an affected party in a letter setting forth the reasons that such variance should be granted. The Tribe, after review of all circumstances and the degree of nuisance, shall reply in writing giving the variance, denying the variance, or setting forth conditions or limitations under which the variance will be granted.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(a)(3)(b)">(b)</span> In the event that the Department issues an order citing a violation of this section on an existing business operation and equipment and the party cited applies for a variance within 10 days of such citation, then all penalties provided shall be tolled from the date the application is filed until a final order or decision has been issued on the merits of the application.</p>

No person shall operate any vehicle on the alleys, streets and highways of the trust lands which, as a result of the nature of the vehicle or the manner it is driven, exceeds the noise levels established in the rules and regulations adopted by the Tribe pursuant to this section. The operation of equipment installed on governmental or other authorized emergency operations and for the safety of the public is excluded from the provisions of this subsection.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(2)">(2)</span> Modification of vehicular equipment. No person shall modify or change the exhaust, muffler, intake muffle or any other noise-abatement device of a vehicle in such a manner that the noise emitted by the vehicle is increased above that emitted by the vehicle as originally manufactured.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(3)">(3)</span> Rules and regulations pertaining to the control of traffic noises. The following practices and acts are prohibited regardless of decibel measurement:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(3)(a)">(a)</span> No vehicle shall be operated in such a manner as to produce loud and unnecessary squealing of tires.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(3)(b)">(b)</span> No vehicle shall sound its horn, bell, or other signaling device except as a danger or cautionary warning. Such warning shall only be sounded for a reasonable and necessary period of time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(3)(c)">(c)</span> No person shall race the engine of a vehicle in such a manner as to produce unreasonably loud and unnecessary engine noises.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(3)(d)">(d)</span> In addition to the above, all subsections within this section will be applied to motor vehicles where applicable.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the denial of an application by the Department for an exemption or variance from the provisions of this section shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the Tribal Legislature, provided that a written request therefor is filed with the Chairperson of the Tribe within 10 days after receipt of the notice of such denial. The Tribal Legislature, after a hearing on such appeal, may affirm, modify or overrule the denial from which the appeal is made.</p>
