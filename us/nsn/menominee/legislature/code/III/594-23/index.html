                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:</p>
                <p>ANIMAL — Any living thing that is not human or a plant and generally capable of voluntary motion or sensation.</p>
                <p>BITTEN — Seizure of any portion of a human being or another animal's anatomy by the teeth or jaws of an animal or contact of saliva from an animal with any break or abrasion of the skin of another animal or person.</p>

                <p>OWNER — Any person keeping, harboring or having charge or control of or permitting any animal to habitually be or remain on or be lodged or fed within buildings or land owned, leased, used or occupied by such person, irrespective of whether such person has legal title or claim to the animal. This term shall not apply to veterinarians or kennel operators temporarily maintaining on their premises animals owned by others and shall not apply to the United States of America, the Menominee Indian Tribe, or the Menominee Kenosha Gaming Authority merely by virtue of its ownership or leasehold interests in the trust lands.</p>

                <p>SCRATCHED — The scraping or clawing of any portion of another animal or a human being's anatomy by an animal.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> No person shall harbor any dog which by loud or frequent or habitual barking, yelping, or howling shall cause serious annoyance to the neighborhood or to persons passing to and from upon the streets. No owner or a person harboring a fierce or vicious dog shall suffer the same to run at large at any time within the lands subject to <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/III/594/II" title="Article II Environmental Health and Food">this article</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> It shall be unlawful for any person owning or possessing any dog or cat to permit it to run at large. "Run at large" means the presence of an animal which is not on a secured leash of six feet or less on any public property or thoroughfare or on any private property without the permission of the property owner or occupier. Dogs and cats which are not leashed in vehicles are not deemed to "run at large" if they are secured in a manner as will prevent their escape therefrom.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Whenever any person designated by the Health Officer shall find any dog or cat running at large as defined, he/she shall, if possible, pick up and impound such animal in such place as the Health Officer may direct; provided, however, that if any such dog or cat is fierce or dangerous, it may be disposed of forthwith. Whenever the owner of any impounded animal shall be identifiable through a collar or license tag, the owner shall be notified by the impoundment facility. Any animal impounded shall be held for a period of seven days to permit the owner to reclaim it. At the end of such period the animal may be disposed of.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Any premises, whether indoors or outdoors, upon which any animal is harbored shall be maintained in a sanitary condition, and all animal feces must be removed and sanitarily disposed of within 24 hours.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> It is unlawful for any person to operate, keep or maintain a kennel without first obtaining a license from the Department and being in compliance with the terms of this section. The fee for a license issued hereunder or renewal thereof shall be determined by motion of the Menominee Tribal Legislature or its designee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(1)">(1)</span> Any applicant for a license or renewal thereof under this section shall file with the Department a fully executed application on a form prescribed by the Department, accompanied by the annual license fee.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(2)">(2)</span> No license or renewal thereof shall issue hereunder until:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(3)">(3)</span> Any license or renewal thereof issued hereunder shall be for a calendar year or portion thereof. Licenses must be renewed each calendar year on or before the 31st day of January. Licenses shall not be assignable or transferable either to another person or for another location.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="F.(4)">(4)</span> When issued, a license shall be displayed in a manner and at a location so as to be readily visible by the public.</p>

The licensee shall, at all times, keep one of such tags, plus a rabies tag obtained from a veterinarian, attached to the collar of each dog over five months old kept on the licensed premises. This requirement to wear a tag and collar does not apply to a dog during competition or training, a dog securely confined indoors, or a dog securely confined in a fenced area.</p>
