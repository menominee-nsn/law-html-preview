                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Establishment and purpose. The Tribal Legislature hereby creates and establishes the Tribal Consumer Financial Services Regulatory Authority ("Authority") as a governmental subdivision of the Tribe. The Authority has charge of the implementation of the tribal consumer financial services regulatory chapter and regulations of the Tribe relating to business activities and associated licensing requirements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Location and place of business. The Authority may maintain its headquarters, principal place of business and office within the Tribal offices. The Authority may, however, with a majority vote from the Tribal Legislature, establish other places of business in such other locations as the Authority may from time to time determine to be in the best interest of the Tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Duration. The Authority shall have perpetual existence and succession in its own name, unless dissolved by the Tribal Legislature pursuant to Tribal law.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Attributes. As a governmental subdivision of the Tribe, the Authority is under the direction and control of the Tribal Legislature, and it is the purpose and intent of the Tribal Legislature that the operations of the Authority be conducted on behalf of the Tribe for the sole benefit and interests of the Tribe, its members, residents of, and visitors to the Tribe's Reservation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)">(1)</span> Arm of Tribe. In carrying out its purposes under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22" title="Chapter 22 TRIBAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION">this chapter</a>, the Authority shall function as an arm of the Tribe. To fund necessary government function and regulatory oversight, the Authority may, upon receiving any necessary approvals from the Tribal Legislature, impose a fee or tax on any financial services licensee or tribal debt collection licensee, and make payment of such a fee or tax subject to a financial services licensee's or tribal debt collection licensee's existing agreements or business relationships, as a condition of its financial services license remaining in good standing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)">(2)</span> Tribal actions. Notwithstanding any powers delegated to the Authority under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22" title="Chapter 22 TRIBAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION">this chapter</a>, the Tribe reserves to itself the right to bring suit against any person or entity in its own right, on behalf of the Tribe or on behalf of the Authority whenever the Tribe deems it necessary to protect the sovereignty, rights and interests of the Tribe, the Authority, or the licensee.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Sovereign immunity of the authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(1)">(1)</span> Immunity from suit. The Authority, as an arm of the Tribe, is cloaked by tribal and federal law with all the privileges and immunities of the Tribe, except as specifically limited by <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22" title="Chapter 22 TRIBAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION">this chapter</a>, including sovereign immunity from suit in any tribal, federal or state Court.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(2)">(2)</span> No Waiver. Nothing in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22" title="Chapter 22 TRIBAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION">this chapter</a> shall be deemed or construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity of the Authority from suit in state or federal Court. Any waiver shall be made pursuant to Subsection E(4), below.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(3)">(3)</span> No consent to jurisdiction. Nothing in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22" title="Chapter 22 TRIBAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION">this chapter</a> shall be deemed or construed to be a consent of the Authority to the jurisdiction of the United States or of any state or of any other tribe with regard to the business or affairs of the Authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="E.(4)">(4)</span> Waiver of sovereign immunity of the Authority. The Authority is only subject to suit pursuant to Article XVIII of the Constitution.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Sovereign immunity of the Tribe. With respect to the existence and activities of the Authority, all inherent sovereign rights of the Tribe as a federally recognized Indian Tribe are hereby expressly reserved, including sovereign immunity from suit in any state, federal or tribal Court. Nothing in <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22" title="Chapter 22 TRIBAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION">this chapter</a> nor any action of the Authority shall be deemed or construed to be a waiver of sovereign immunity from suit or counterclaim of the Tribe, a consent of the Tribe to the jurisdiction of the United States, any state or other tribe with regard to the business or affairs of the Authority or the Tribe, a consent of the Tribe to any cause of action, counterclaim, case or controversy, or to the levy of any judgment, lien or attachment upon any property of the Tribe, a consent to suit or counterclaim in respect to any land within the exterior boundaries of the Tribe's reservation, or to be a consent to the alienation, attachment or encumbrance of any such land.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> Assets of the Authority. The Authority shall have only those assets specifically assigned to it by the Tribal Legislature, acquired in its name by the Tribe, or acquired by the Authority on its own behalf. No activity of the Authority or any indebtedness incurred by it shall implicate or in any way involve any assets of tribal members or the Tribe not assigned in writing to the Authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H.">H.</span> Regulatory agents; compensation, duties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(1)">(1)</span> Regulatory agents; legislative oversight. The Authority shall be composed of at least one but not more than three agents appointed by the Tribal Legislature. The agents will be employees of the Tribe and subject to the Tribe's employment policies and professional and ethics standards. The Tribal Chairman will supervise the agents for employment purposes.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(2)">(2)</span> Term of office. Agents shall serve three-year terms unless an agent is removed or otherwise replaced by the Tribal Legislature, or the agent's term is extended. There are no limits to the number of terms a person may serve.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(3)">(3)</span> Staggered terms. The Tribal Legislature shall not replace more than one agent per calendar year unless necessitated by Subsection K based on events beyond the control of the Tribal Legislature. The Tribal Legislature may extend any agent's term as necessary to comport with <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22-4#H.(3)" title="">this subsection</a>.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(4)">(4)</span> Compensation. The compensation of the agents shall be established from time to time by the Tribal Legislature.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(5)">(5)</span> Duties. The agents shall have responsibilities that include but are not limited to:</p>

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="H.(5)(c)">(c)</span> The agents may identify additional duties and assign particular duties to an agent or an Authority employee. Compensation shall be submitted to the Tribal Legislature with the Authority's annual budget approved by the Tribal Legislature.</p>
