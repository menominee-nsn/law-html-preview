A creditor may charge and collect interest under a revolving credit plan on outstanding unpaid indebtedness in the consumer's account under the plan at such daily, weekly, monthly, annual or other periodic percentage rate or rates as the agreement governing the plan provides or as established in the manner provided in the agreement governing the plan subject to the maximum interest rate prescribed herein.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(4)(a)">(a)</span> Periodic interest may be calculated using any method provided for under the plan.

                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(4)(b)">(b)</span> Maximum interest rate. No creditor may charge an interest rate under the plan in which the scheduled finance charges exceed $50 per $100 of principal per billing cycle.

All such fees must be disclosed and approved pursuant to the requirements of <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22" title="Chapter 22 TRIBAL CONSUMER FINANCIAL SERVICES REGULATION">this chapter</a> to consumers before any loan may be issued to a consumer.</p>

If the agreement governing a revolving credit plan so provides, a creditor may impose a late or delinquency charge upon any outstanding unpaid installment payments or portions thereof under the plan which are in default; provided, however, that no more than one such late or delinquency charge may be imposed in respect of any single such installment payment or portion thereof regardless of the period during which it remains in default; and provided further, however, that for the purpose only of the preceding provision all payments by the consumer shall be deemed to be applied to satisfaction of installment payments in the order in which they become due. Nothing contained in this section shall limit, restrict or otherwise affect the right of a creditor under and pursuant to <a class="internal-link " href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/I/22-8" title="§ 22-8 Authorized consumer financial services transactions and debt collection activities.">Subsections C and D of this section</a> to change the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest applicable to the revolving credit plan between the creditor and a consumer upon the occurrence of a delinquency or default or other failure of the consumer to perform in accordance with the terms of the plan.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(9)">(9)</span> Attorneys' fees; costs. In the event a consumer defaults under the terms of a plan, the creditor may, if the consumer's account is referred to an attorney (not a regularly salaried employee of the creditor) or to a third party for collection and if the agreement governing the revolving credit plan so provides, charge and collect from the consumer a reasonable attorneys' fee or the fee charged by any third party to collect the amount due. In addition, following a consumer's default, the creditor may, if the agreement governing the plan so provides, recover from the consumer all court, alternative dispute resolution or other collection costs (including, without limitation, fees and charges of collection agencies) actually incurred by the creditor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(10)">(10)</span> Application of other laws. Any federal law not applicable to Indian tribes or state law limiting the rate or amount of interest, discount, points, finance charges, service charges or other charges which may be charged, taken, collected, received or reserved shall not apply to extensions of credit under a revolving credit plan operated in accordance with this section.</p>

The finance charge may be calculated, earned and scheduled for payment as agreed by the parties as long as the finance charges as originally scheduled for payment do not exceed the maximum allowable amount set forth herein.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(5)">(5)</span> Variable rates. If the agreement governing the loan so provides, the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest charged and collected in respect of the loan may, if the interest is not precomputed and taken in advance, vary in accordance with a schedule or formula. Such periodic percentage rate or rates may vary from time to time as the rate determined in accordance with such schedule or formula varies and such periodic percentage rate or rates, as so varied, may be made applicable to all or any part of outstanding unpaid amounts of such loan on and after the effective date of such variation. This section shall not be construed to limit the authority of a creditor to charge and collect interest in respect of a loan in the manner and at the rate or rates authorized in any other subsection of this section. Without limitation, a permissible schedule or formula hereunder may include provisions in the agreement governing the loan for a change in the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest applicable to all or any part of outstanding unpaid amounts whether by variation of the then-applicable periodic percentage rate or rates of interest, variation of an index or margin or otherwise, contingent upon the happening of any event or circumstance specified in the loan agreement, which event or circumstance may include the failure of the consumer to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(6)">(6)</span> Additional charges. In addition to or in lieu of interest at a periodic percentage rate or rates permitted by this section, the creditor may charge and collect:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(6)(a)">(a)</span> If the agreement governing the loan so provides, charge and collect any other fees or charges, costs, points, premiums and all other expenses which may be assessed by the creditor in connection with the loan.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(6)(b)">(b)</span> If the agreement governing a loan so provides, a creditor may impose, as interest, a late or delinquency charge upon any outstanding unpaid installment payments or portions thereof under the loan agreement which are in default; provided, however, that no more than one such delinquency charge may be imposed in respect of any single such installment payment or portion thereof regardless of the period during which it remains in default. Nothing contained in this section shall limit, restrict or otherwise affect the right of a creditor under and pursuant to this section to change the periodic percentage rate or rates of interest applicable to the loan agreement between the creditor and a consumer upon the occurrence of a delinquency or default or other failure of the consumer to perform in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, provided that such changes and variances are disclosed to and approved by the consumer;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(6)(c)">(c)</span> Such other charges as are set forth in the agreement governing the loan, including, but not limited to, costs, fees, services, points, premiums and all other reasonable expenses which may be incurred by such applicant in connection with a loan. No creditor shall demand, collect or receive from any applicant for a loan, directly or indirectly, any other charges, or any greater amounts for any authorized charges than those permitted by this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(7)">(7)</span> Deferred installments. A creditor may at any time or from time to time permit a consumer to defer installment payments of a loan and may, in connection with such deferral, charge and collect deferral charges and may also require payment by such consumer of the additional cost to the creditor of premiums for continuing in force, until the end of such period of deferral, any insurance coverage provided in connection with the loan pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(8)">(8)</span> Refinancing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(8)(a)">(a)</span> A consumer may, with the consent of the creditor, refinance the entire outstanding and unpaid amount of a loan, and the creditor may charge and collect a refinancing charge in connection with any such refinancing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(8)(b)">(b)</span> For the purposes of this section, the entire outstanding and unpaid amount of a loan shall be deemed to be the total of the unpaid balance and the accrued and unpaid interest and charges on the date of refinancing.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(8)(c)">(c)</span> Number of loan transactions at one time. A creditor may enter into no more than three loans with any consumer at any time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="C.(9)">(9)</span> Duration. A creditor may not provide loan transactions, whether short-term consumer loans or Small Dollar consumer loans for a term of less than three days or more than 48 months.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Short-term consumer loans.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)">(1)</span> In addition to such other limitations and requirements as are imposed pursuant to other provisions of this section, short-term consumer loans shall be subject to the following:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(a)">(a)</span> No creditor shall make more than four rollovers of an existing short-term consumer loan. After the fourth rollover, the creditor must enter into a workout agreement with the consumer that allows for the pay down of at least 5% of the principal of the loan per month over a maximum forty-eight-month period or take such other actions as are lawful to collect any outstanding and unpaid indebtedness.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(b)">(b)</span> No creditor shall make a short-term consumer loan unless such loan is subject to a right of rescission on the part of the individual consumer.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(c)">(c)</span> No creditor shall pursue or threaten to pursue criminal action against an individual consumer in connection with the nonpayment of any amount due, including the unpaid return of any check or automated clearing-house transaction.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(d)">(d)</span> In addition to such other disclosure requirements as are imposed pursuant to other provisions of this section, loans shall be subject to the following: No creditor shall make a loan unless the application for such loan contains a written disclosure, conspicuously displayed, that:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(d)[1]">[1]</span> The loan is designed as a short-term cash-flow solution and not designed as a solution for longer-term financial problems; and</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(1)(d)[2]">[2]</span> Credit counseling services are available to consumers who are experiencing financial problems.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(2)">(2)</span> Nothing in this section prohibits a creditor from refinancing the principal amount of a loan, subject to the limitations and requirements imposed herein.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(3)">(3)</span> Every loan provider must post, in plain view on all of its websites, a schedule of fees and rates applicable to their loans, and a prominent statement that: "A small-dollar consumer loan is not intended to meet long-term financial needs."</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(4)">(4)</span> Attorneys' fees; costs. In the event a consumer defaults under the terms of a loan, the creditor may, if the consumer's account is referred to an attorney (not a regularly salaried employee of the creditor) or to a third party for collection and if the agreement governing, or the bond, note or other evidence of, the loan so provides, charge and collect from the consumer a reasonable attorneys' fee. In addition, following a consumer's default, the creditor may, if the agreement governing, or the bond, note or other evidence of, the loan so provides, recover from the consumer all court, alternative dispute resolution or other collection costs (including, without limitation, fees and charges of collection agencies) actually incurred by the creditor.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(5)">(5)</span> Application of other laws. Any federal law not applicable to Indian tribes or state law limiting the rate or amount of interest, discount, points, finance charges, service charges or other charges which may be charged, taken, collected, received or reserved shall not apply to extensions of credit under a loan operated in accordance with this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(6)">(6)</span> No oral agreements. A consumer financial services transaction may provide that it represents the entire agreement of the parties and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements of the parties. Such provisions are enforceable and disallow evidence of oral agreements.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(7)">(7)</span> Enforcement of creditor's rights and remedies. In any proceeding in which a licensee is a party in interest with respect to any transactions with a consumer, the licensee's rights and remedies shall be granted based upon prima facie proof and entitlement based upon the terms of the written transaction documents and the payment and business records maintained by the licensee in the ordinary course of business.</p>
