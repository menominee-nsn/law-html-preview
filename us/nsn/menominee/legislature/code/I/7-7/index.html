                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide definitions of terms (and abbreviations) as they are used when discussing the financial and management accounting system.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Definitions.</p>

                <p>ACCOUNTING SYSTEM (ACCTG SYS) — The total structure of records and procedures which record, classify and report information on the financial position and operations of a government unit or any of its funds and organizational components.</p>
                <p>APPROPRIATION (APPROPN) — An authorization granted by the Tribal Legislature to make expenditures and incur obligations for specific purposes. (Note: Appropriations are specified as to the amount and the time in which they must be expended.)</p>
                <p>BUDGET (BUDGT) — A plan of financial operation embodying proposed expenditures for a given period and the proposed means of financing them. Used without any modifier, the term indicates a financial plan for a single year.</p>
                <p>BUDGETARY ACCOUNTING (BUDGT ACCTG) — The element of the standard governmental accounting system which is directed toward satisfying legal requirements for budgetary control and reflecting budgetary operations and conditions. Funds, budget units and budgetary accounts, such as estimated revenues and appropriations, are components of the element of the accounting system.</p>
                <p>BUDGETARY CONTROL (BUDGT CNTRL) — The control or management of a government unit or enterprise in accordance with the approved budget for the purpose of keeping expenditures within the limitations of available appropriations and available revenues.</p>
                <p>BUDGET UNIT (BUDGT UNIT) — The basic accounting entity within the operating funds. The level to which budget appropriations are made by the Tribal Legislature and to which, in most instances, appropriations are controlled.</p>
                <p>CASH MANAGEMENT (CASH MNGT) — Allocating, spending, investing, conserving, safeguarding, and otherwise handling cash or its equivalent in a manner intended to result in its most efficient use.</p>
                <p>CODING (COD) — A system of numbering or otherwise designating accounts, entries, invoices, vouchers, etc., in such a manner that the symbol used reveals quickly certain required information.</p>

                <p>appropriation is obligated. They cease to be encumbrances when paid or when the actual liability is recorded.</p>
                <p>EXPENDITURE (EXPEND) — Where the accounts are kept on the cash basis, this term designates only actual cash disbursements for these purposes. Where the accounts are kept on the accrual basis or the modified accrual basis, this term designates the cost of goods delivered or services rendered, whether paid or unpaid, including expenses, provision of debt retirement and capital outlays.</p>
                <p>EXPENSE APPROVAL AUTHORITY (EXP APP ATHY) — An individual or a position that has been authorized by the Tribal Legislature to approve purchase orders, contracts, time cards, etc., that are consistent with all underlying agreements and program objectives, to the level of appropriations approved by the Tribal Legislature.</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(2)">(2)</span> (Noun) The point at which the two entities form a common unit. <strong>[Amended 5-23-1997]</strong></p>
                <p>MODIFIED ACCRUAL BASIS (MOD ACCR BASIS) — The accrual basis, as recommended for government units, does not require that uncollected revenues, if the option to accrue is exercised, and unpaid expenditures be recorded in the books of account on a day-to-day basis; it is sufficient that they be recorded at the close of the fiscal year.</p>
                <p>REVENUE (REV) — For those revenues which are recorded on the accrual basis, this term</p>
                <p>designates additions to assets which do not increase any liability, do not represent the recovery of an expenditure, do represent the cancellation of certain liabilities with a corresponding increase in assets, and do not represent contributions of fund capital to fund capital of another intra-governmental unit. The same definition applies to those cases where revenues are recorded on the modified accrual or cash basis, except that additions would be partially or entirely to cash.</p>
                <p>STRUCTURE LEVEL ACCOUNT (STR LV ACCT) — A number included in the chart of accounts published by the Department of Finance. The structure level account classifies account numbers by functions, fund, subfund, program/contract and cost centers.</p>
                <p>SUBSYSTEM (SUBSYS) — A smaller system nested within a large system, e.g., general ledger subsystem is a member of the budgetary accounting system.</p>
                <p>SYSTEM (SYS) — A set of elements forming an activity or processing procedure, seeking common goals, by operating on data in a time reference to yield information, e.g., payroll system.</p>
