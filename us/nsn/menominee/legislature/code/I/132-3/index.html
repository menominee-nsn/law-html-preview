Reasonable grounds are defined as a quantum of information that is greater than that which would justify a stop, but less than that required for probable cause.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(8)">(8)</span> After having identified himself or herself as a police officer, a police officer may stop a person in a public place for a reasonable period of time when the officer reasonably suspects that such person is committing, is about to commit, or has committed a crime, and may demand the name, address, and status as an Indian of the person and an explanation of the person's conduct. Such detention and temporary questions shall be conducted in the vicinity where the person was stopped.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(8)(a)">(a)</span> When a law enforcement officer has stopped a person for temporary questions pursuant to this subsection and reasonably suspects that he or she or another is in danger of physical injury, the police officer may search such person for weapons or any instrument or article or substance readily capable of causing a physical injury and of a sort not ordinary carried in public places by law abiding persons. If the police officer finds such a weapon or instrument, or any other property that may constitute a threat to his or her safety, the police officer may take it and keep it until the completion of questioning, at which time the law enforcement officer shall either return it, if lawfully possessed, or arrest the person so questioned.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(8)(b)">(b)</span> An officer who stops a person on reasonable suspicion may not frisk the person for evidence. When an officer conducts a proper weapons frisk and has probable cause to believe that an object is evidence of a crime, the officer may remove the object; however, the officer may not manipulate or explore the object further if the officer does not immediately recognize that the object is evidence of a crime.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(9)">(9)</span> A police officer stopping in compliance with an approved impaired-driving checkpoint conducted under a checkpoint plan and guidelines regulating officer discretion.

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(11)">(11)</span> A police officer may detain occupants during search warrant service if the occupants are in the immediate vicinity of the area described in a valid search warrant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(12)">(12)</span> Within the territorial jurisdiction of the Menominee Indian Tribe, a tribal police officer may detain nonindians for delivery to state or federal authorities for prosecution. Such detention shall be no longer than is reasonable for the other jurisdiction to arrive.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(13)">(13)</span> As authorized by other tribal laws or lawful court orders.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="D.(14)">(14)</span> A tribal police officer's arrest authority and law enforcement authority may expand beyond territorial jurisdiction of the Menominee Indian Tribe by cooperative agreements with federal, state, county, or city governments if approved by the Menominee Tribal Legislature, or as specifically authorized by federal law.</p>
