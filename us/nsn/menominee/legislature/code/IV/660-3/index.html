                <p>Pursuant to Article XIII, Menominee Constitution, this tribally chartered business shall have as its form of management a Board of Directors.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> Members. [Amended 2-4-2021 by Ord. No. 20-43]</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)">(1)</span> The Board shall consist of five members. Three members shall be members of the Menominee Tribal Legislature, with no more than one Legislator appointed from each class, unless there are no Legislators in a class willing or eligible to act as a Director, in which case the Legislature may appoint a Legislator from any class. If determined necessary by the Menominee Tribal Gaming Commission, these Legislative members shall maintain a valid gaming license. Membership of Tribal Legislator members on the Board is coterminous with the current legislative term of the appointed Board member. The two other members of the Board must meet the following criteria:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)(a)">(a)</span> Adult enrolled member of the Menominee Tribe;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)(b)">(b)</span> Must be able to pass a background check, and, if determined necessary by the Menominee Tribal Gaming Commission, maintain a valid gaming license;</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(1)(c)">(c)</span> Demonstrated knowledge of and participation in Menominee Tribe's efforts to develop a gaming business in Kenosha, Wisconsin.</p>
                <p class="center ">The term of members who are not current Menominee Legislators shall be three years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="A.(2)">(2)</span> All members shall be appointed by the Menominee Tribal Legislature by motion. If the Legislature determines that there are not persons available who meet the requirements of Subsection A(1)(a) through (c) the Legislature may choose to leave one or both of these non-Legislator Board member seats vacant.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Conflict of interest prohibited. Pursuant to Article XVII, Menominee Constitution, Board members shall not make or participate in making any decision which involves a substantial personal financial interest, other than those interests held in common by all tribal members.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Powers of Board. The Board shall possess powers listed in Article XIII, Menominee Constitution, and shall be governed by limitations listed therein. The Board is hereby delegated all proprietary powers of the Tribe necessary to permit the Authority to discharge its obligations and to enforce its rights under this Charter and the power to enact and from time to time amend a gaming ordinance and implementing regulations to regulate the conduct of gaming on Kenosha property, provided that such ordinance shall not conflict with any agreement referred to in § 660-10 of this Charter, and provided further that such ordinance shall provide for a regulatory body separate from the Board. Until the Board enacts any such ordinance and it becomes effective, the Gaming Control Code shall apply to the gaming operation. The Board is also authorized to adopt such bylaws as the Board deems reasonable and to conduct all other activities reasonably necessary to implement the powers enumerated above or to further the business needs of the Authority.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Meetings. The Board shall meet a minimum of four times a year. Additional meetings may be held at the written request of two members of the Board. Places of meetings shall be set by the Board or by the members calling the meeting; provided, however, that such meeting places shall be reasonably accessible for attendance by tribal members. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may hold meetings by telephone conference when, as determined by the Chairperson or by the members calling the meeting, it would be impractical to convene a meeting at which all Directors or a quorum will be physically present. In addition, the Board may take action without a meeting if a consent, in writing, setting out the action so taken, is signed by the number of the Directors required by this Charter to take such action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Quorum. The quorum for any meeting of the Board shall be the majority of the Directors then in office. <strong>[Amended 2-4-2021 by Ord. No. 20-43]</strong></p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Notice of meetings. Seventy-two hours' notice of meetings shall be given to Board members, verbal or written, unless circumstances, as determined by the Chairperson of the Board, shall indicate a shorter time.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> Officers. The Tribal Legislature shall name the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. The Board may name other officers from its members, including a Vice Chairperson, a Secretary, and a Treasurer, and may define their duties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H.">H.</span> Compensation. The Board may receive a reasonable compensation for service on the Board; provided, however, that such compensation shall not exceed the compensation provided for the Tribal Legislature. Compensation under this provision may be revised on an annual basis.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I.">I.</span> Annual business meeting. The Board shall hold an annual business meeting on the second Saturday of April for the purpose of informing tribal members of the operation of the Authority for the past year. This meeting shall be held in Keshena, Wisconsin, at a time and place reasonably accessible to tribal members. In the event of failure, through oversight or other compelling reasons, to hold the annual business meeting as provided for herein, a subsequent meeting shall be held within 30 days of written request from a tribal member. The Board shall cause the management of the gaming operation to be present at the annual business meeting.</p>
