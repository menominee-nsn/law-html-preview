In accordance with Article XII of the Constitution, before this Charter becomes effective, a Board of Directors as provided for herein shall be elected. Pursuant to its constitutional mandate, the Tribal Legislature sets forth below the procedure to be followed for a special election of the initial Board of Directors of the successor business, MTE.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> The Tribal Legislature shall schedule a special election for the initial MTE Board of Directors pursuant to this Charter to be held on a date to be determined by the Tribal Legislature.</p>

Four members of the Board of Directors may be from off Reservation and be elected to the Board as off-Reservation members. Eight members of the Board shall be residents of the Reservation. In the event that more than four members are elected from off Reservation, only the top four candidates shall be considered winners of seats on the Board. Off-Reservation candidates who may receive votes among the top 12 candidates in excess of the four top off-Reservation candidates shall be declared ineligible for office by the election commission. Ties shall be decided by some means of chance. Any dispute or request for a recount shall be filed with the election commission within five calendar days of the election. On the sixth calendar day following the special election, the newly elected Board of Directors shall have its organizational meeting as provided for herein.</p>
