                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="A.">A.</span> General powers. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by its Board of Directors. The Board of Directors will determine the manner in which it will exercise its authority and responsibility for the management of the Corporation and the manner and extent to which such powers will be delegated to committees of the Board of Directors or to officers, agents, and employees of the Corporation. In general, the Board of Directors shall be responsible for establishing overall policies and objectives for the management of the affairs and assets of the Corporation and for periodically reviewing and evaluating management results.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="B.">B.</span> Number, tenure, nomination and qualifications of Directors. There shall be three Directors who shall serve for a period of three years.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="C.">C.</span> Vacancies. Any vacancy occurring in the Board of Directors may be filled until the next succeeding annual business meeting by a majority vote of the MTL. In the event that such vacancy or vacancies create difficulty achieving a quorum to take up necessary business, a majority of Directors even if less than a quorum may fill such a vacancy by appointing a temporary Director to serve as Director for one meeting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Qualifications. To be considered for appointment to the Board of Directors, a person must meet all of the requirements of the federal and tribal law, be an enrolled Menominee and exhibit understanding of business principles.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="E.">E.</span> Restrictions. All Directors shall be enrolled Menominee tribal members, but no Director shall be an employee of a gaming enterprise operated by the Corporation or by any tribe which has any contract with the Corporation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="F.">F.</span> Conflicts of interest prohibited. In carrying out the duties of the Board of Directors, no member of the Board shall make or participate in making decisions which involve balancing a substantial personal financial interest, other than interests held in common by all tribal members.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="G.">G.</span> Regular meetings. A regular meeting of the Board of Directors shall be held immediately after, and at the same place as, each annual business meeting. The Board of Directors may provide, by resolution, for the holding of additional regular meetings at specified times. No notice need be given for such annual meetings or additional regular meetings.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="H.">H.</span> Special meetings. Special meetings of the Board of Directors may be called by the Chairperson of the Board and shall be called by the Secretary on written request of any two Directors. The person or persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix any place for holding any special meeting of the Board of Directors.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="I.">I.</span> Notice of special meetings.

Whenever any notice is required to be given to any Director under the provisions of this Charter, a waiver thereof, signed at any time by the Director entitled to such notice, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. The attendance of a Director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a Director attends a meeting and there objects to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. The business to be transacted at any special meeting of the Board of Directors need not be specified in the notice or waiver of notice of such meeting.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="J.">J.</span> Quorum. Two of the Directors then in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the Board of Directors. If less than such quorum is present at a meeting, a majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="K.">K.</span> Manner of acting. The act of the majority of the Directors present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Board of Directors, unless the act of a greater number is required by this Charter.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="L.">L.</span> Compensation. The Board of Directors shall not be compensated for any meetings; provided, however, that the Board members may be compensated for travel and per diem if they are on official Corporation business tasks.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="M.">M.</span> Presumption of assent. A Director who is present at a meeting of the Board of Directors or a committee thereof at which action on any matter is taken shall be presumed to have assented to the action taken unless he or she objects to such action at the meeting or unless he or she files his/ her written objection to such action with the Secretary of the Corporation within 72 hours after the adjournment of the meeting. Such right to object shall not apply to a Director who voted in favor of such action.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="N.">N.</span> Informal action. Any action required or permitted by this Charter or by any provision of applicable law may be taken by the Board of Directors at a meeting. Such action may also be taken without a meeting if a consent, in writing, setting forth the action taken, is signed by all of the Directors then in office.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="O.">O.</span> Committees.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="O.(1)">(1)</span> The Board of Directors may designate one or more committees, including an Executive Committee which may be empowered to take temporary actions and to act in lieu of the Board of Directors when the Board is not in session. Each committee shall consist of no fewer than three and no more than five Directors. The members of each committee and the Chairperson thereof shall be designated. Such committees may exercise any powers of the Board of Directors, as set forth in the resolution appointing each committee, except that committees shall not be empowered to act in respect to the distribution of profits, amendments to the agreement, execution of contracts, election of permanent officers, or filling of vacancies on the Board of Directors or on committees created pursuant to this section.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="O.(2)">(2)</span> The Board of Directors may elect one or more of its members as alternate members of any such committee, who may take the place of any absent member or members at any meeting of such committee upon request by the Chairperson of the Board, President, or the Chairperson of such committee. The Board of Directors may also designate such persons who are not Directors to serve as advisory members of any committee. Such advisory members shall have no power to vote on any matter in which the committee is exercising the power of the Board of Directors in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="O.(3)">(3)</span> The Chairperson of each committee of the Board of Directors shall submit a report from time to time of the activities and actions of the committee. Such reports will be submitted as the Board of Directors or the Chairperson of the Board of Directors may request and shall be delivered to the Chairperson of the Board of Directors for submission to the Board of Directors. The Chairperson of the Executive Committee shall submit such reports and shall provide all members of the Board of Directors with copies of minutes of all Executive Committee meetings. In exercising his/her duties of Chairperson of any committee, the Chairperson may request, through the Chairperson of the Board of Directors or the Executive Director/Administrator, such information from the officers, agents, or employees of the Corporation as such committee may require from time to time in fulfilling its duties.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="O.(4)">(4)</span> Notice of meetings of committees of the Board of Directors shall be given in accordance with this Charter. The majority of the number of Directors on a committee shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business at such meeting. Committees may make rules, not inconsistent with any provisions of this Charter, for conducting committee business.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="P.">P.</span> Indemnification of Directors and officers. Each present, former, and future Director and officer of the Corporation shall be entitled, without prejudice to any other rights he may have, to be reimbursed and indemnified from assets of the Corporation for any of the following: all legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by him in connection with any claim, action, suit, or proceeding of whatever nature in which he may be involved as a party or otherwise by reason of his having served as a Director or officer of the Corporation or of any subsidiary of the Corporation, whether or not wholly owned, or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted by him as any such Director or officer, provided that the Corporation need reimburse such officer's or Director's legal fees and expenses only if those fees are incurred after the officer or Director has requested, and the Corporation has refused to provide, legal representation to the officer or Director at the Corporation's expense. Reimbursement and indemnification under <a class="internal-link no-wrap" href="/us/nsn/menominee/legislature/code/IV/663-4#P." title="">this subsection</a> include amounts paid or incurred in connection with reasonable settlements made with a view to curtailment of costs of litigation and with the approval of a majority of the Directors of the Corporation then in office, other than those involved, whether or not such majority constitutes a quorum. No such reimbursement or indemnification shall relate to any expense incurred or settlement made in connection with any matter arising out of the negligence or misconduct of such Director or officer as determined either by a court of competent jurisdiction or, in the absence of such a determination, by such majority of the Directors acting on the advice of counsel. The Corporation and its Directors, officers, employees, and agents shall not be liable to anyone for making any determination as to the existence or absence of liability, or for making or refusing to make any payment hereunder on the basis of such determination, or for taking or omitting to take any other action hereunder, in reliance upon the advice of counsel.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="Q.">Q.</span> Recall of Directors. Directors may be recalled from office on grounds of dishonesty, incompetence, nonparticipation in Board matters, or other conduct seriously detrimental to the interests of the Tribe or of the Corporation. The Menominee Tribal Legislature may recall any Director from office upon a simple majority vote of those present, so long as a quorum exists.</p>
