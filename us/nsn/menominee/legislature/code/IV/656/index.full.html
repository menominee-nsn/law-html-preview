One of the members will be selected from the Department of Finance based upon the recommendation of the Financial Manager to the Tribal Legislature. One of the selected Board members must be a member of the Tribal Legislature, selected by the Tribal Chairperson and approved by the Tribal Legislature, whose term will extend only as long as his/her current term on the Tribal Legislature. The terms of the Board of Directors will be staggered terms. In order to ensure that the terms are staggered, the initial five members, with the exception of the appointed Tribal Legislator, selected under this charter, will draw for two three-year terms, one two-year term, and one one-year term at their first regular meeting. After these initial terms expire, all future selections will be for three-year terms. Board members may be removed and replaced by other eligible persons when the Tribal Legislature determines such action is in the best interests of the Tribe. After appointment of the Board by the Legislature, the Board shall organize itself by a set of laws which provide for the orderly conduct of business, including but not limited to officers, meetings, reports and other matters. The Board members shall receive payment of $50 per meeting plus mileage reimbursement at the federal rates for their services.</p>
