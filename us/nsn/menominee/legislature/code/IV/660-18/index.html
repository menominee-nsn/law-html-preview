                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="B.(1)">(1)</span> The Board of Directors, and any agent or employee of MIGA designated by the Board, shall submit monthly reports to the Tribal Legislature by the last Thursday of each month for the previous month and may be subject to more frequent periodic reporting requirements if the Tribal Legislature determines that such reports are necessary.

Nothing in this Subsection D shall prohibit a Director who is a member of the Menominee Tribal Legislature from making or participating in any decision of the Board which involves the Menominee Indian tribe.</p>
                <p class="text-indent-1 "><span class="level-num" id="D.">D.</span> Indemnification. Each present, former, and future member of the Board of Directors shall be entitled to be reimbursed and indemnified from assets of MIGA for all legal and other expenses reasonably incurred by him in connection with any claim, action, suit or proceeding of whatever nature in which he may be involved as a party or otherwise by reason of his having served as a member of the Board of Directors or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or omitted by him as a member of the Board of Directors (including settlement amounts approved by a majority of Directors then in office other than those involved), provided that MIGA need reimburse such Director's legal fees and expenses only if they are incurred after the Board of Directors has refused to provide legal representation to the Director at MIGA's expense. No such reimbursement or indemnification shall be made in connection with any matter arising out of the negligence or misconduct of such Director. Neither this subsection nor any action or inaction by the Board of Directors under this subsection shall create any liability against the Board of Directors or MIGA.</p>
